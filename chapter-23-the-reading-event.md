# Chapter 23: The Reading Event

Monday afternoon, Mrs. Whitmore made an announcement at the end of our English class.

"Don't forget," she said, gathering her teaching materials from her desk, "that the annual literary magazine reading is coming up in three weeks. I'll be posting a sign-up sheet outside the magazine office tomorrow for students who want to read their work. This is always a lovely evening, and I encourage you all to participate—either as readers or audience members."

The annual reading. I'd almost forgotten about it, which was strange considering I'd read at the event both previous years as the magazine's editor. It was one of Windermere's traditions—an evening in the auditorium where students shared their creative work, with the whole school invited to attend.

Last year, I'd read an essay about the power of literature to create empathy across distances. The year before, a short story about finding your voice.

Both pieces felt safe now in retrospect. Polished and intellectual, revealing nothing particularly personal.

"Emma, you'll read again this year, won't you?" Sarah asked as we filed out of the classroom. "It's tradition. The editor always reads."

"I haven't decided," I said honestly.

"You should." Sarah's enthusiasm was genuine. "Your pieces are always so good. Everyone looks forward to hearing what you'll share."

I mumbled something noncommittal and headed toward my next class. But the idea of the reading event stayed with me all afternoon, turning over in my mind like a stone I couldn't set down.

That evening, Madison brought it up.

We were in our dorm room—me attempting calculus homework at my desk, Madison on her bed organizing her field hockey equipment. The radio played softly in the background, some love song I didn't recognize.

"You're going to read at the literary magazine event, right?" Madison asked without preamble.

I looked up from the problem I'd been staring at without solving. "I don't know. Maybe."

"You should."

"Why?"

Madison set down the stick she'd been taping and gave me a significant look. "Because it's the perfect opportunity."

"For what?"

"To be honest. Publicly." Madison leaned forward. "You've been writing in your journal constantly since the whole Derek situation started. Pages and pages about feelings and confusion and trying to understand. Why not craft something from all that writing and share it?"

The suggestion made my stomach flip. "Share what, exactly? My personal drama with Derek Lane?"

"Not the specifics," Madison clarified. "But the themes. The journey. What you've learned about seeing people wholly, about different sides of the same person, about the courage to be vulnerable."

"That's terrifying."

"Yes," Madison agreed cheerfully. "But also brave. And honest. And exactly the kind of thing that would help you work through everything."

I turned the idea over in my mind. My journal had become my refuge this past week—the place where I processed all the confusion and hurt and gradual understanding. Pages about discovering that Compass was Derek, about struggling to reconcile two versions of the same person, about my own fear of real vulnerability.

It was raw and messy and painfully honest.

The thought of reading any of it publicly made me want to hide under my bed.

"I don't think I can do that," I said.

Madison shrugged. "Then don't. But Emma—you've spent weeks writing to Compass, pouring your heart out in letters. You've filled your journal with honest thoughts about all of this. You're clearly someone who processes through writing."

"That's different. The letters were anonymous, and the journal is private."

"Exactly," Madison said. "You're brave and honest when you feel safe. But being brave when it's not safe—when it costs you something, when it makes you vulnerable—that's real courage."

Her words echoed what I'd realized during our late-night conversation. About the difference between safe connection and real connection.

"Derek took a real risk," Madison continued. "Being vulnerable in those letters, then admitting they were real even after you reacted badly. Maybe it's your turn to take a risk."

I thought about that. Derek had been vulnerable first—in the letters, in the magazine office, even in the hallway when I'd confronted him. He'd been honest about his feelings, his confusion, his hurt.

And I'd told him I couldn't reconcile who he was.

Maybe Madison was right. Maybe I needed to take a risk too. Show vulnerability not from behind the safety of an anonymous pseudonym, but as myself. Publicly.

The thought terrified me.

Which probably meant I should do it.

The next day, I signed up for a reading slot.

My hand shook slightly as I wrote "Emma Sullivan" on the list outside the magazine office. Several students had already signed up—Charlotte Reynolds, a few juniors from the creative writing elective, some seniors I knew from the literary magazine staff.

Once my name was on the list, there was no backing out without everyone noticing.

Good. I needed that commitment.

Now I just had to figure out what to read.

---

That evening, I spread my journal open on my desk in the magazine office. The pages from the past two weeks told a complete story—shock and hurt transforming into confusion, confusion into grudging understanding, understanding into recognition of my own fear.

It was all here. The journey from believing Compass and Derek were irreconcilable to realizing they'd always been the same complicated, multifaceted person.

But I couldn't just read journal entries aloud. They were too scattered, too personal in their specificity.

I needed to craft something. Transform the raw material into a piece that captured the essential truth without exposing every detail.

I pulled out a fresh piece of paper and started writing.

*Sometimes the person who challenges you is the person who understands you best.*

I stared at that opening line. Too obvious? Too revealing?

I crossed it out. Started again.

*We spend so much time trying to know people—to understand who they really are. But what if the truth is that people are multiple things at once? Vulnerable and confident. Certain and questioning. And knowing them means accepting all those facets, not choosing one and rejecting the others.*

Better. More universal. But also true to what I'd learned.

I kept writing. Words about the danger of wanting people to be simple, uncomplicated. About the temptation to know someone in one context and assume that's all they are. About learning that someone can show you different sides of themselves depending on whether they feel safe, and both sides are equally real.

About discovering that the person whose arguments frustrated you might be the same person whose words moved you, and the dissonance isn't a contradiction—it's complexity.

I kept writing.

The hours slipped past. Outside the magazine office windows, evening deepened into night. The academic building grew quiet, most students at dinner or evening study hours.

I wrote about the complexity of human nature. About different contexts revealing different sides of the same person. About falling for words and then discovering the person behind them was both more complicated and more real than you'd imagined.

About having the courage to see someone fully instead of in the comfortable pieces you prefer.

I didn't name Derek. Didn't mention the letter exchange specifically. But the piece was about us, about what I'd learned, about the journey from confusion to understanding.

By the time I finished the first draft, my hand ached from writing and the page was covered in crossed-out words and margin notes. But I had something. A beginning.

---

Over the next three weeks, I revised constantly.

In the magazine office during free periods. In my dorm room after Madison fell asleep. Even during moments between classes when I should have been reading for other assignments.

The piece evolved with each revision. Became tighter, clearer, more honest. I cut sections that felt too self-indulgent, expanded parts that didn't quite capture what I meant. I read it aloud to myself to test the rhythm, made sure it would work spoken as well as written.

Each revision brought me closer to what I actually wanted to say—not just about Derek, but about myself. About my own fear of complexity, my own tendency to compartmentalize people into versions I could understand instead of accepting them wholly.

The piece became a mirror as much as a declaration.

"How's your reading coming?" Sarah asked me one afternoon when she stopped by the magazine office to drop off submissions.

"Good, I think." I covered the pages I'd been working on—the gesture automatic, protective.

"Will you tell me what it's about?"

"Not yet." I managed a smile. "You'll hear it at the reading."

After Sarah left, I uncovered the pages and read through what I'd written. It was more personal than anything I'd shared publicly before. More vulnerable.

It terrified me.

But it also felt right. True in a way my previous reading pieces hadn't been.

Madison read the final draft two days before the event.

I'd been nervous showing it to her—worried she'd say it was too revealing, too obviously about Derek, too raw to share with the entire school. But Madison read it carefully, then looked up with tears in her eyes.

"Emma," she said softly. "This is beautiful."

"Really?"

"Really. It's honest and brave and exactly what you need to say."

"What if people know it's about Derek and me?"

"So what if they do?" Madison handed the pages back to me. "You're not naming names. You're sharing what you've learned. That's what makes it powerful."

I looked down at my piece. At the words I'd crafted so carefully over three weeks, trying to capture the truth of what I'd learned about seeing people wholly.

In three days, I'd stand in front of the entire school and read this aloud.

Derek would be in the audience. He'd hear every word. He'd know—of course he'd know—that I was writing about us.

The thought made my hands shake.

But I didn't change anything.

This was my truth. My understanding. My declaration that I was trying—really trying—to see him completely.

Whether Derek still wanted that from me, I didn't know.

But at least he'd know I'd tried to find the courage he'd shown me first.
