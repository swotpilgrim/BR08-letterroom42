# Chapter 11: Wishing for Reality

I've imagined meeting Compass two dozen different ways.

Sometimes it's dramatic—we bump into each other in the library, I drop my books, our eyes meet and somehow we just *know*. Sometimes it's ordinary—we're assigned as lab partners in a class we share, and gradually the reality of him matches the version I know from letters. Sometimes it's disappointing—he's someone I've already dismissed as boring or wrong for me, and the revelation ruins everything.

I shouldn't be imagining it at all. We agreed to keep the correspondence anonymous, to value the purity of connection through words alone.

But I can't stop wondering.

Sunday evening, drafting my latest letter to Compass, I finally write what I've been thinking for weeks.

*Compass,*

*I need to confess something: I want to meet you.*

*I know we agreed anonymity allows vulnerability. I know removing that protection might change what we have. But I can't stop imagining what it would be like to talk to you face-to-face. To hear your voice. To see the expressions that go with the thoughts you share so beautifully in writing.*

*I've imagined meeting you dozens of times. Walking across campus and suddenly knowing. Sitting next to you in a class I've taken all semester without realizing. Finding out you're someone I already know but haven't really seen.*

*I'm curious who you are. Where you sit in the dining hall. What you look like when you're thinking through a difficult question. Whether your spoken words match the careful composition of your letters.*

*But I'm also afraid. Afraid that knowing your identity will change how I read your letters. Afraid that the physical reality of you won't match the person I've come to care about. Afraid that suggesting we meet will ruin the safety of what we have now.*

*So I'm not asking to meet. Not yet. I'm just admitting that I wish I could. That anonymity feels both precious and limiting. That I'm torn between wanting to preserve what we have and wanting to make it real.*

*Does any of that make sense?*

*—Navigator*

I read it over three times before sealing it. It's vulnerable in a new way—not about my fears and dreams, but about my feelings for Compass specifically. About wanting more than letters.

Monday morning, I drop it in the submission box and spend the next two weeks in a state of anxious anticipation.

The response arrives on a gray December afternoon when campus is dusted with the season's first snow.

I collect the magazine from my mailbox and immediately flip to the letter exchange section, standing right there in the mailroom despite the cold air blowing in every time the door opens.

*Navigator,*

*Your letter made my heart race. Not just because of what you said, but because I've been wanting to say the same thing and didn't know how.*

*I want to meet you too. I want to know if your voice sounds the way I imagine it. I want to see your face when you laugh or when you're thinking something through. I want to have a conversation in real time instead of across weeks and printed pages.*

*But I'm also afraid. What if meeting changes what we have? Right now, we connect purely through ideas and honesty. No physical attraction or social dynamics to complicate things. Adding those layers might ruin the clarity of what we've built.*

*And what if you're disappointed? What if I'm not what you imagined? What if the person I am in letters is somehow different from the person I am in real life?*

*I think we're both grappling with the same tension: this correspondence has become the most important relationship in my life, and I want to protect it. But protecting it means keeping it limited, and I'm starting to chafe against those limits.*

*So here's what I propose: let's stay anonymous for now, but acknowledge that we both want more eventually. Let's keep writing honestly about this tension. And when we're ready—when the risk feels worth it—we'll figure out how to meet.*

*Is that okay? Or am I being a coward by not suggesting we meet immediately?*

*I'm curious too, Navigator. I find myself looking at classmates wondering if any of them might be you. Trying to match the person I know from letters with the people I see every day. It's maddening and thrilling and terrifying all at once.*

*Thank you for being brave enough to admit you want to meet. Thank you for trusting me with that vulnerability.*

*—Compass*

I read the letter standing in the mailroom, then again walking to the dining hall, then a third time sitting at my usual table while Madison tries to get my attention.

"Emma. Earth to Emma."

I look up. "Sorry."

"Compass's response?" She doesn't wait for confirmation. "Based on your expression, I'm guessing it's significant."

"He wants to meet too." I keep my voice low, aware of our tablemates. "But he's also afraid of ruining what we have. So we're staying anonymous for now."

"How do you feel about that?"

I consider the question. "Relieved? Disappointed? Both?"

"Both seems reasonable."

She's right. Part of me is glad we're not rushing into a meeting that could destroy everything. But another part of me is frustrated by the continued limbo, the wanting without having, the imagining without knowing.

I glance around the dining hall. Senior boys scattered across various tables—some I know well, some barely at all. Is one of them Compass?

The boy who sits with the debate team, always gesturing enthusiastically during conversations—could that be him? He seems passionate about ideas, but would he be vulnerable enough to write Compass's letters? Or the quiet one from the newspaper staff who reads during meals? He has the literary bent, but would he be as questioning, as philosophical?

Or someone from Bancroft Hall, maybe Andrew Mitchell's friend group? Someone I've seen but never really noticed?

My gaze drifts toward the Bancroft section and catches on Derek Lane, who's laughing at something Andrew just said. For a moment I imagine Derek as Compass, try to reconcile the argumentative classroom presence with the vulnerable letter-writer.

It doesn't fit. Not even close.

I return my attention to Madison, but I catch her watching me with that knowing expression.

"What?"

"You were looking at Derek."

"I was looking at the Bancroft section generally."

"Uh-huh." Madison takes a bite of her salad. "You know, has it occurred to you that Compass might be someone you already know?"

"Obviously. That's what I was just doing—wondering if I know him."

"I meant someone you know well. Someone you interact with regularly."

I shake my head. "I'd recognize the way they think. Compass has a specific voice, specific perspectives. If I knew him, I'd notice the parallels."

"Would you though? If you've already decided someone is one way, would you notice evidence that contradicts that assumption?"

I don't like where this is going. "Are you suggesting Derek is Compass?"

"I'm suggesting you might be too quick to dismiss people who don't fit your predetermined categories."

"Derek is not Compass." I'm very certain about this. "They're completely different. Compass is vulnerable and thoughtful. Derek is combative and—"

"Thoughtful?"

I pause. Derek is thoughtful, actually. His arguments are carefully constructed. His points are well-considered. He clearly thinks deeply about the texts we read.

"Different kind of thoughtful," I clarify. "Derek performs his intelligence. Compass actually shares his uncertainties."

Madison doesn't push it, but I can tell she's not convinced.

That night, I write in my journal—something I haven't done as regularly since starting the correspondence with Compass.

*It's strange to fall for someone's mind before their face. To know their fears and dreams but not their eye color. To care deeply about someone you've never had a real-time conversation with.*

*Compass understands me better than almost anyone. He asks the right questions. He validates my struggles while also challenging me to think differently. Reading his letters feels like coming home to a place I didn't know existed.*

*But he's not real in the way other people are real. He's words on a page. Beautiful, honest words—but still just ink and paper.*

*I want him to be real. I want to see him across the dining hall and know it's him. I want to have the kind of connection we have in letters, but in person, unfolding in real time.*

*Is that possible? Can the person who writes so vulnerably also be someone I'd connect with face-to-face? Or is the anonymity essential to the honesty?*

*I don't know. But I'm starting to think staying anonymous forever isn't actually an option. Eventually, one of us will need to be brave enough to risk revealing ourselves.*

*I'm just not sure I'm that brave yet.*

I close my journal and look around the dorm room. Madison is at her desk, studying for a chemistry exam with intense focus. She's real—physically present, knowable, complicated in ways that letters can't fully capture.

Compass is somewhere on this campus, probably also awake, maybe also thinking about today's letter exchange. So close and yet completely unknown.

I imagine walking up to a stranger tomorrow and asking, "Are you Compass?" Imagine the possibility of finally knowing, of making this real.

But then I imagine being wrong. Or worse—being right but discovering that the person who writes beautiful letters is disappointing in person. That the connection we have on paper doesn't translate to actual chemistry.

The risk feels enormous.

So I return to my homework, push away the imaginings, and tell myself that staying anonymous a while longer is the right choice.

But I know that won't last forever.

Eventually, the desire to make this real will outweigh the fear of losing what we have.

Eventually, I'll want to meet Compass badly enough to risk everything.

I'm just not there yet.
