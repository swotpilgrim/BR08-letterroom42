# Chapter 2: Words in Print

The mailroom smells like paper and anticipation.

I stand near the back wall, pretending to check my own mailbox while actually watching students collect the first issue of *The Windermere Review* from the distribution rack. Sarah insisted we place copies in every student's box early this morning, which means by mid-morning break, word has spread that the new issue is out.

I watch a sophomore girl pull the magazine from her mailbox, flip immediately to the table of contents, then carry it toward the dining hall with her friend. Two junior boys scan the pages while leaning against the wall. A senior I don't know well tucks her copy into her bag without opening it, but at least she's taking it.

"You're being creepy," Madison observes, appearing at my elbow. "Lurking in the mailroom watching people read."

"I'm observing reader response."

"You're being creepy," she repeats, but she's smiling. "Come on. Let's get breakfast and you can watch people read there like a normal person."

The dining hall is already buzzing when we arrive. I spot at least a dozen copies of the magazine on various tables, students reading between bites of scrambled eggs and toast. My heartbeat picks up. This is the moment—either people care about the letter exchange feature, or they don't.

Madison and I claim seats at the Ashford table. I force myself to eat while trying not to obviously stare at the girls two seats down who have the magazine open between them.

"—anonymous, see? You just drop a letter in the box and they assign you a pseudonym—"

"But how do you know who you're writing to?"

"You don't. That's the point."

My chest tightens with something that feels like hope.

"People seem interested," Madison says quietly, following my gaze.

"Maybe."

Across the dining hall, I spot Sarah at another table, also watching reactions. She catches my eye and grins, giving me a subtle thumbs up. At least my staff believes in this.

After breakfast, I head to English early, hoping to skim my reading before class. But when I arrive, several students are already there, and two of them have copies of the magazine.

"Sullivan." Charlotte Reynolds looks up from where she's sitting on one of the desks, the magazine open on her lap. "This letter exchange thing—can people respond to specific letters, or is it all random?"

I set my bag down carefully, trying not to show how pleased I am that Charlotte—who normally doesn't acknowledge the magazine's existence—is asking questions.

"People can respond to specific letters," I explain. "Just reference the pseudonym in your submission. If both people keep responding, a correspondence can develop across multiple issues."

"Interesting." Charlotte taps the page thoughtfully. "So it's like pen pals, but you have no idea who you're talking to."

"Exactly."

"Could be anyone in the school," the boy next to her adds. "Someone in your class, or a freshman, or whoever."

Charlotte's expression shifts to something speculative. "That's actually kind of intriguing."

I settle into my seat, pulling out my copy of *Jane Eyre* and trying to contain the satisfaction warming my chest. Charlotte Reynolds thinks the feature is intriguing. That's—well, that's good for distribution numbers, if nothing else.

By lunch, the buzz has grown. I hear fragments of conversation as I walk across campus:

"—thinking about submitting something—"

"—wonder who'll actually use it—"

"—can't believe it's totally anonymous—"

In the magazine office during free period, Sarah practically bounces through the door.

"Emma! The drop box has submissions already. I checked it an hour ago and there were at least five letters."

My stomach flips. "Already?"

"Already." Sarah drops into the chair across from my desk. "People are actually doing it. I mean, I know we hoped they would, but I wasn't sure—"

"Me neither," I admit.

We grin at each other like conspirators.

"Want to read them?" Sarah asks.

I hesitate. The submissions aren't for me to read as Emma Sullivan, curious student. They're for me to read as Emma Sullivan, editor—which means reading them with the weight of responsibility, of making sure we honor whatever vulnerability people have offered.

"Let me finish this layout first," I say. "Then we'll go through them together, assign pseudonyms, match any responses."

Sarah nods, understanding. She's been on staff long enough to know that the editorial work is sacred. We're not just publishing content—we're holding people's words carefully.

By evening, back in my dorm room, I finally let myself collapse onto my bed with a copy of the magazine. Madison is at field hockey practice, which means I have the room to myself—rare quiet in a place where privacy is measured in minutes, not hours.

I open to the letter exchange section and read my own editor's note as if seeing it for the first time:

*Welcome to Letters to Room 42 and Beyond—a space for anonymous exchange. Submit handwritten letters to the drop box outside the Review office. We'll assign you a pseudonym. Your letter may be answered by another student, and if you wish to continue the correspondence, simply reference your correspondent's pseudonym in your next submission. All letters remain anonymous unless both parties agree to reveal identities. Say what you need to say. Find the words that matter.*

Room 42 was Sarah's idea—she said it sounded specific enough to be intriguing but vague enough to mean anything. Letters to everywhere and nowhere, all at once.

I trace the words with my finger. This is real now. People are actually participating, actually trusting this space we've created.

The door bursts open and Madison enters, cheeks flushed from practice, duffel bag slung over her shoulder.

"Tell me people are reading it," she says immediately.

"People are reading it." I sit up. "And submitting letters. Sarah said at least five were in the drop box by this afternoon."

Madison drops her bag and flops onto her own bed. "That's great! See? I told you it would work."

"You told me it was idealistic."

"Idealistic things can work. Sometimes." She rolls onto her side to face me. "So are you going to participate?"

The question I've been avoiding all day.

"I'm the editor," I say slowly.

"And?"

"And it feels weird to participate in my own feature."

Madison props herself up on one elbow. "Why? You're still a student. You're still part of this community. Just because you're editing the section doesn't mean you can't also use it."

I pick at the corner of the magazine. "I don't know what I'd say."

"Emma." Madison's voice is patient. "You have a journal full of things you'd say. You write constantly about stuff you can't tell your parents, about your worries and dreams and all the things that keep you up at night. This is just—a different audience for that. Someone who might understand."

She's not wrong. My journal is full of thoughts I'd never say aloud, fears I barely admit to myself. The pressure of choosing a major that satisfies my parents. The terror that I'm not actually talented enough to pursue writing. The loneliness of feeling like the only person at Windermere who cares more about words than about whatever practical future everyone else is planning.

"What if nobody responds?" I ask quietly.

"What if somebody does?"

Madison sits up fully now, her expression serious in a way it rarely gets.

"Look," she says. "You created this space because you believe in connection through words, right? You believe that sometimes writing lets us be more honest than speaking. So practice what you're preaching. Submit something real and see what happens."

I close the magazine, running my thumb along its spine. She's right. I know she's right. But there's something terrifying about the vulnerability of it—putting my actual feelings into the world and waiting to see if anyone cares enough to respond.

"I'll think about it," I concede.

Madison rolls her eyes but doesn't push. "At least you're thinking about it. That's progress."

That night, after lights out, I lie in bed staring at the ceiling. Madison's breathing has evened out into sleep, but I'm wide awake, my mind churning.

What would I write, if I were brave enough?

I'd write about the weight of other people's expectations. About loving words and stories but being afraid that love isn't enough to build a life on. About watching my parents worry over bills and knowing they see my writing dreams as frivolous, impractical, a luxury they sacrificed to give me opportunities for something more stable.

I'd write about the guilt that comes with wanting something different than what they want for me. About feeling selfish for choosing passion over security when they've given up so much.

I'd write about feeling caught between who I am and who I'm supposed to become.

But that's too much, too vulnerable. Isn't it?

The whole point of the feature is anonymity allowing honesty. And if I don't trust my own creation enough to use it, what does that say?

I roll over, pulling my blanket up to my chin. Tomorrow, maybe. Tomorrow I'll think about what I might say, if I could find the courage to say anything at all.

For now, it's enough that other people are braver than me. Enough that the space exists, that students are reaching out through words, that maybe someone will find the connection they're looking for.

But Madison's question echoes in my mind: *What if somebody does?*

What if I submitted something honest, and someone understood? What if there's another person at Windermere who feels the same impossible tension between passion and practicality, who understands what it's like to love something you're told isn't enough?

What if I'm not alone in this?

The thought sits in my chest, equal parts terrifying and thrilling.

Tomorrow, I tell myself. Tomorrow I'll decide if I'm brave enough to find out.
