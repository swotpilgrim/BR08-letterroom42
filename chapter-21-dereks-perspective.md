# Chapter 21: Derek's Perspective

Sunday afternoon, I saw Derek and Andrew on the quad.

They were sitting on one of the wooden benches near the oak tree, deep in conversation. Andrew was leaning forward, gesturing emphatically, while Derek sat with his arms crossed, shoulders hunched. Even from a distance, I could see the tension in Derek's posture.

Andrew's expression was earnest, almost pleading, and Derek looked defeated—the same defeated look I'd seen in the library yesterday. They were clearly arguing about something.

I forced myself to turn away, continue toward the library. Their conversation wasn't my business.

But I couldn't stop thinking about the look on Derek's face.

---

Later that afternoon, I ran into Andrew at the student center.

Andrew was at one of the tables, surrounded by textbooks but clearly not studying. He saw me before I could pretend I hadn't seen him.

"Emma." He said it carefully. "Can you sit for a minute?"

Every instinct told me to make an excuse and go. But Andrew's expression was kind, concerned.

I sat.

"I saw you and Derek on the quad earlier," I said before I could stop myself. "It looked like a serious conversation."

Andrew nodded. "It was." He studied me for a moment, clearly weighing how much to say. "Derek told me what happened. About the letters. About you and him."

Heat flooded my face. Of course Derek had told Andrew. They were roommates, close friends. It made sense. But knowing Andrew was aware of the whole messy situation made everything feel more exposed.

"Oh," was all I could manage.

"He's struggling," Andrew said quietly. "I don't think I've ever seen him this torn up about anything."

The words hit harder than they should have. "I'm struggling too."

"I know." Andrew's voice was gentle. "That's kind of obvious. You two have been avoiding each other all week, and you both look miserable."

"We had a fight," I said, defensive. "In the hallway after English class. He said—" I stopped, not sure how much Derek had shared.

"He said you can't see him as a whole person," Andrew finished. "Yeah, he told me."

I looked down at my coffee cup. "He's right. I couldn't reconcile the person who wrote those letters with the person I knew in class. They seemed like completely different people."

"Were they though?" Andrew leaned back in his chair, regarding me thoughtfully. "Or were they just different sides of the same person?"

It was almost exactly what Madison had said. "I don't know anymore."

Andrew was quiet for a moment, then seemed to make a decision. "Can I tell you something about Derek? As his friend who's known him for two years?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

"Derek debates with you because you're the smartest, most interesting person at Windermere," Andrew said simply. "He doesn't debate people whose opinions don't matter to him. He debates people he respects, whose minds interest him enough that he wants to understand how they think."

The words echoed what Derek had said in the magazine office. *Challenging someone isn't dismissing them.*

"He could have told me that," I said quietly. "Instead of just... arguing all the time."

"Maybe." Andrew shrugged. "But Derek's not great at being vulnerable in person. All that pressure he's under—scholarship kid, top grades, parents who want him to be practical and successful—he's learned to keep his guard up. Be confident, be certain, be the guy who has it all figured out."

"But he's not that guy."

"No," Andrew agreed. "He's anxious and uncertain and scared about his future just like the rest of us. He just hides it better. Until he started writing those letters."

I thought about Compass's vulnerability, the honesty about fear and expectations.

"The letters were where Derek felt safe being honest," I said slowly.

"Exactly. Anonymous letters meant Derek could just be himself. No performance, no expectations."

"He said the same thing in the magazine office," I admitted. "That the correspondence was the most real thing in his life at Windermere."

"It was." Andrew's voice was firm. "I've roomed with Derek for two years. I've never seen him as happy as he was when he was writing to Navigator. Coming back from dropping off letters, reading responses, working on his next piece—he was different. More relaxed. More himself."

The image formed clearly in my mind: Derek in Room 42, bent over a piece of paper, writing with that fountain pen I'd imagined, letting himself be vulnerable in a way he couldn't manage face-to-face.

Writing to me.

"He feels like you want Compass but not him," Andrew said quietly. "Like the real Derek—the one who debates and challenges and isn't always sure how to be emotionally honest in person—isn't good enough for you."

The words landed like a physical blow. "That's not—I never said that."

"You said you couldn't reconcile the two versions of him," Andrew pointed out gently. "That Compass and Derek were different people. Derek heard that as: you fell for Compass, but Derek isn't who you want."

God. I'd been so focused on my own confusion and hurt that I hadn't thought about how my words would sound to Derek. How it must have felt to be told that the person you'd opened up to, been vulnerable with, couldn't see you as whole.

"I was confused," I said, but it sounded like an excuse even to me. "It was such a shock, finding out Compass was Derek. I didn't know how to process it."

"I get that." Andrew's tone was understanding, not judgmental. "It's a weird situation. But Emma—can you see now that Derek and Compass are the same person? Just in different contexts, showing different sides?"

I thought about the letters I'd reread, the words that mirrored what Derek had said in person. Vulnerability in writing, intellectual engagement in debate. Two different languages for the same person.

Just like Navigator and Emma Sullivan were the same person in different contexts.

"I'm starting to," I admitted. "See that they're the same person, I mean. That Derek shows vulnerability through writing and engagement through debate, and both are real."

"That's good," Andrew said. "That's a start."

"But I don't know what to do with that understanding." The confession came out small, uncertain. "Derek and I had that awful fight. He walked away from me. I don't think he wants to hear from me anymore."

Andrew gave me a look that was somewhere between sympathetic and exasperated. "Emma. Derek is miserable without you. Both versions of you—Navigator on paper and Emma in person. He misses the correspondence and he misses the debates and he's completely lost without either."

"How do you know?"

"Because I found him in our room yesterday reading old magazine issues and looking like someone had died." Andrew's voice was blunt but kind. "And when I asked him about it, he said everything's ruined. That the best thing in his life at Windermere turned out to be someone who wishes he were different than he is."

The pain in those words cut deep. Because Derek was wrong. I didn't wish he were different.

I just hadn't known how to see him clearly.

"I suggested he try to combine the written honesty with real-world interaction," Andrew continued. "Be vulnerable with you in person the way he was in letters. But he said he didn't know how when you clearly can't accept who he actually is."

"I can," I said urgently. "I'm trying to. I just needed time to—"

"So tell him that." Andrew leaned forward. "Tell Derek, not me. He's the one who needs to hear it."

"What if it's too late? What if he's already decided Navigator—or Emma—isn't worth the complication?"

"It's not too late." Andrew said it with complete certainty. "But Emma, you have to actually talk to him. This silence isn't solving anything. It's just making you both miserable."

He was right. Madison had said the same thing, in her own way. The silence between Derek and me had stretched from hours to days to a week, and all it had done was make the distance feel insurmountable.

"I don't know what to say," I admitted.

"Start with the truth." Andrew gathered his textbooks, preparing to leave. "Tell him you were confused and scared and reacted badly. Tell him you're trying to see him as a whole person. Tell him you miss Compass and you miss the debates and you want to figure out if the connection can translate beyond letters."

"What if he doesn't feel the same anymore?"

Andrew stood, gave me a look that was almost pitying. "Emma. Derek Lane has been falling for you since September. In class debates and in letters and probably in every way in between. The question isn't whether he feels the same. The question is whether you're brave enough to be honest with him the way he was honest with you."

He left then, leaving me alone with his words echoing in my head.

*Derek Lane has been falling for you since September.*

I'd been so focused on falling for Compass's words that I'd missed the possibility Derek had been falling for me too. That the debates were his way of connecting.

That I'd been falling for him too, without realizing it.

I thought about Derek in the library, staring at old magazine issues. Derek on the quad, looking defeated. Derek walking away from me after I'd told him I couldn't reconcile who he was.

He'd been honest with me—in letters, in the magazine office, in that hallway confrontation. He'd told me the correspondence was real, that he was the same person in both contexts.

And I'd told him I didn't believe him.

I gathered my things and left the student center, Andrew's words still ringing in my ears. *It's not too late.*

But I'd have to be brave enough to believe that.

Brave enough to reach out to Derek—not Compass, but Derek—and be honest about everything I'd been feeling.

The question was: did I have that kind of courage?
