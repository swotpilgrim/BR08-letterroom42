# Chapter 13: Madison's Theory

Madison waits until Saturday evening to ambush me.

We're both in our dorm room—me curled up on my bed with Compass's latest letter, Madison allegedly studying for Monday's chemistry exam. But I can feel her watching me instead of reading her textbook.

"Emma, we need to talk."

I look up from the letter. "About what?"

"About Derek Lane."

My stomach tightens. "What about him?"

Madison closes her chemistry book and turns to face me fully. "You talk about him constantly."

"I do not."

"You absolutely do. 'Derek said this in class.' 'Derek argued that about the assignment.' 'Derek made this point about Fitzgerald.' 'I had coffee with Derek.'" She's counting on her fingers. "You've mentioned him at least once a day for the past two weeks."

"Because he's in my seminar and we're working on similar papers—"

"Emma." Madison's tone is patient but firm. "You talk about him more than anyone else at Windermere except Compass. And unlike Compass, Derek is actually here, in your real life, having real conversations with you."

I set down the letter. "What's your point?"

"My point is that you're protesting way too much about disliking him."

"I don't dislike him. I just find him frustrating."

"Do you though?" Madison leans forward. "Because from where I'm sitting, it looks a lot more like you find him engaging, challenging, and increasingly interesting. The frustration is just your cover story."

My face heats. "That's not true. Derek and I are intellectually incompatible. He treats everything like a debate to win. I value genuine connection over intellectual combat."

"Incompatible." Madison repeats the word slowly. "Really? Because you spent two hours getting coffee with him. You smiled for the rest of that afternoon. You've been noticeably happier since you started collaborating on your papers."

"That's just because the work is going well—"

"It's because Derek makes you happy." Madison's expression is gentle but unyielding. "And you're terrified to admit it because it complicates your feelings for Compass."

The accusation hangs in the air.

"I don't have feelings for Derek," I say finally. "I have feelings for Compass. Real feelings. Deep feelings for someone who actually understands me."

"I'm not saying you don't. I'm saying you might have feelings for both of them."

"That's impossible."

"Why? You're allowed to be attracted to more than one person. You're allowed to connect with different people in different ways."

I shake my head. "It's not the same. Compass and I have this profound emotional connection. Derek is just—he's argumentative and sarcastic and he hides everything behind intellectual games."

"Does he?" Madison tilts her head. "Or is arguing his way of being vulnerable? His way of actually engaging instead of staying surface-level?"

"That's not vulnerability. That's the opposite of vulnerability."

"Is it? Emma, think about it. Derek doesn't debate with everyone. He saves his real arguments for you. He shows up, unguarded, willing to be wrong in front of you, willing to have his ideas challenged. That takes trust."

I want to dismiss this, but something about it rings uncomfortably true.

"Compass writes me letters about his deepest fears," I counter. "About disappointing his parents, about not being talented enough, about choosing between passion and practicality. That's vulnerability. Derek just likes arguing about books."

"Maybe Derek shows vulnerability differently than Compass. Maybe his version looks like intellectual engagement instead of emotional confession." Madison pauses. "Has it occurred to you that someone can challenge you and care about you simultaneously? That debate might actually be Derek's love language?"

The phrase "love language" makes my heart skip.

"You're reading way too much into this."

"Am I? Or are you reading way too little because you've already decided Derek is one thing and Compass is another and never shall the two overlap?"

"They're completely different people!"

"Are they though?" Madison's voice is quiet. "Or have you just put them in different boxes so you don't have to think about what it means that you care about both of them?"

I stand up, suddenly needing space. "This is ridiculous. I'm not having feelings for Derek. I find him interesting to talk to about literature. That's professional, collegial interest. What I have with Compass is something real."

"And what you have with Derek isn't real?"

"It's different."

"Different doesn't mean lesser. It just means different." Madison stands and moves to lean against her desk, giving me space but not letting the conversation drop. "Look, I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm just pointing out what I see. You light up when you talk about Compass's letters. But you also light up when you recount debates with Derek. Both are real."

"But one is deeper—"

"Is it? Or is one just more comfortable because it's anonymous and safe? Emma, you can fall for someone's mind through letters. But you can also fall for someone's mind through real-time conversation. They're both valid."

I pace to the window, looking out at the darkening quad. A few students are walking back from the library, their breath visible in the cold air. Ordinary people having ordinary Saturday evenings, not grappling with impossible questions about connection and feelings and identity.

"Compass is honest and vulnerable," I say, more to the window than to Madison. "Derek hides behind sarcasm and intellectual posturing. They're fundamentally incompatible types of people. And I'm falling for Compass, not Derek."

"Okay." Madison's tone suggests she doesn't believe me but isn't going to push. "If you say so."

"I do say so."

The conversation ends there, but it doesn't leave.

After Madison falls asleep, I lie in bed thinking about her theory.

The idea that Derek's argumentativeness might be vulnerability feels wrong. Vulnerability should look like Compass's letters—honest admissions of fear and uncertainty, questions about meaning and purpose, confessions about feeling lost.

But then I remember the coffee conversation. The way Derek talked about Fitzgerald being complicit in the systems he critiqued. The way he gestured while explaining his ideas, completely unself-conscious. The moment when he admitted he thinks through argument, not because he wants to be difficult but because that's genuinely how his mind works.

Was that vulnerability? Showing me his actual thought process, explaining why he engages the way he does?

No. That's just self-awareness, not vulnerability.

Except... what if Madison's right that vulnerability looks different for different people? What if Compass's careful written confessions and Derek's real-time intellectual engagement are both forms of showing up honestly?

I roll over, frustrated with my own thoughts.

The problem is that Madison is suggesting I have feelings for Derek, and that's impossible. I barely tolerated him a month ago. He irritated me constantly. We argued about everything.

But we don't argue the same way anymore. The edge is gone. The debates have become collaborations. The antagonism has shifted into something that feels almost like partnership.

And I did enjoy that coffee more than I've enjoyed most interactions this semester. More than I've enjoyed conversations with people I'm supposedly friends with.

And I do think about our conversations afterward, replaying his points, appreciating his insights. Looking forward to the next seminar to see what he'll say.

And when he waved before walking away, I did feel something that might have been disappointment that we couldn't keep talking. That our time together had to end.

And when he complimented the way I think, when he said my face lights up, I felt warm in a way that has nothing to do with academic satisfaction.

But that's not the same as having feelings for him. That's just appreciating someone's mind, enjoying intellectual chemistry.

Right?

Except intellectual chemistry is still chemistry. And enjoying someone's company is still enjoying them.

I think about the way Derek said "Your whole face lights up when you talk about literature." The way he noticed I have different modes of presentation. The way he insisted on citing our conversation because intellectual honesty matters to him.

I think about how he makes me feel sharp and alive and capable of more than I knew.

And I think about how different that is from how Compass makes me feel—understood and seen and known.

Two completely different things.

Two completely different people.

Except I'm lying here at midnight thinking about both of them, and that has to mean something.

---

Sunday morning, I draft a letter to Compass without mentioning Madison's theory or the confusing conversation about Derek.

Instead, I write about the Gatsby paper, about finding new angles in familiar texts, about the satisfaction of collaborative intellectual work. Safe topics. Honest but not revealing the full truth of my confusion.

Because the truth is I don't know how to tell Compass I might be developing complicated feelings for someone in my real life. Someone who challenges me in ways that are starting to feel less frustrating and more essential.

I seal the letter and promise myself I'll think about Madison's theory later.

But later turns into days, and the question doesn't go away.

Do I have feelings for Derek?

Am I falling for two completely different people in two completely different ways?

And if I am—what does that mean about who I am and what I actually want?

I don't have answers.

I just have a growing sense that the clear distinctions I've been drawing—Compass versus Derek, emotional connection versus intellectual engagement, vulnerability versus argument—might not be as clear as I thought.

And that terrifies me more than I'm willing to admit.
