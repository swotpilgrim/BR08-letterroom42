# Chapter 25: The Reading

The auditorium filled slowly, students and faculty trickling in by twos and threes. From backstage, I could hear the rising hum of conversation, the scrape of chairs, the settling-in sounds of an audience gathering.

My hands wouldn't stop shaking.

"You're going to be great," Sarah said from beside me. She was reading tonight too—a poem about autumn that she'd workshopped in Mrs. Whitmore's class. She seemed calm, excited even.

I felt like I might throw up.

"Thanks," I managed.

Charlotte Reynolds was backstage as well, looking elegant in a navy cardigan and khakis, her reading pages neatly organized. She caught my eye and smiled—friendly enough, though I couldn't help wondering if she knew my essay would be about Derek. If everyone would know.

Madison appeared at my elbow, even though she wasn't reading. "I snuck back here to give you encouragement," she whispered. "You're going to be amazing."

"What if I can't do it?" My voice came out small. "What if I get up there and can't actually read the words?"

"Then you'll push through anyway." Madison squeezed my hand. "Because you're brave, Emma. Braver than you think."

I wanted to believe her.

Through a gap in the curtain, I could see the auditorium filling up. The rows of seats were maybe two-thirds full already—better attendance than I'd expected for a student reading event. Mrs. Whitmore had positioned herself near the front, along with Mr. Harrison and a few other English teachers. Students filled the middle and back sections, some genuinely interested in literature, others probably here because they had to be for extra credit.

And then I saw Derek.

He came in with Andrew, both of them scanning the auditorium for seats. They chose spots in the middle section, a few rows back from the teachers. Derek was wearing a dark green sweater over his oxford shirt, his hair slightly less neat than usual like he'd been running his fingers through it.

My heart lurched.

He was here. Really here. Would hear every word I'd written.

Andrew said something to Derek, who nodded without smiling. Even from backstage, I could see the tension in Derek's shoulders, the way he held himself carefully. He didn't look around the auditorium the way Andrew did. Just sat with his hands clasped between his knees, staring at the stage.

Waiting.

"Places, everyone," Mrs. Whitmore called softly from backstage. "We're about to begin."

---

The first reader was a junior named Michael who read a short story about a boy learning to play guitar. It was sweet and well-written, and the audience clapped appreciatively when he finished.

Charlotte went second, reading a polished personal essay about family traditions. Her voice was clear and confident, and I could see Mr. Harrison nodding along approvingly.

Sarah read her autumn poem third. It was lovely—imagery about leaves changing color and time passing—and she smiled with relief when she finished to warm applause.

I was fourth.

Mrs. Whitmore stepped to the microphone between readers, acting as emcee. "Our next reader is Emma Sullivan, who many of you know as the editor of *The Windermere Review*. Emma has contributed beautiful work to our literary community throughout her time at Windermere, and I'm excited to hear what she's chosen to share tonight."

That was my cue.

I stood, my essay clutched in hands that still trembled slightly. Madison gave me an encouraging nod from the wings. I took a breath and walked onto the stage.

The auditorium was bright from my vantage point—lights positioned to illuminate the stage made the audience fade slightly, which was both comforting and unnerving. I could see shapes and faces but not details. Couldn't read individual expressions.

Except I knew exactly where Derek was sitting. Middle section, few rows back. Even without seeing his face clearly, I could feel his attention focused on me.

I stepped up to the microphone and set my essay on the stand. Took another breath. The paper trembled slightly in the light breeze from the auditorium's ventilation system.

This was it. No going back now.

"This is a personal essay," I said, and my voice came out steadier than I'd expected. "About learning to see people fully."

Then I began to read.

The first few sentences came out carefully, each word deliberate. But as I moved deeper into the essay, something shifted. The nervousness didn't disappear, but it transformed into something else. Conviction, maybe. These words were true, and truth had its own kind of power.

"*We spend so much time trying to know people—to understand who they really are. But what if the truth is that people are multiple things at once? Vulnerable and confident. Certain and questioning. And knowing them means accepting all those facets, not choosing one and rejecting the others.*"

My voice found its rhythm. The essay I'd read aloud to myself dozens of times in practice flowed naturally now, the words familiar and true.

"*I used to think you could know someone in one context and that would tell you who they were. The person who writes you vulnerable letters is sensitive and honest. The person who argues with you in class is combative and difficult. But what if both are true? What if the same person shows you different sides depending on whether they feel safe, and both sides are equally real?*"

The auditorium was completely silent. No rustling papers, no whispered conversations. Just listening.

I kept reading.

I read about the temptation to compartmentalize people into versions we can understand. About the discovery that someone can be both the person whose words move you and the person whose challenges frustrate you—and refusing to see them as integrated is really just fear of complexity.

I read about different love languages. About learning that some people show care through gentle support while others show it through rigorous challenge. About recognizing that someone who pushes you might be pushing *toward* something, not away.

"*I learned that anonymity feels safe because it gives you control. You can reveal exactly as much as you want, hide the parts that don't fit the story you're telling, walk away if it gets too real. But that safety comes at a cost. You never get to know the whole person—just the version they show you in that one context. And they never get to know the whole you.*"

My eyes had adjusted to the stage lights. I could see the audience now—Mrs. Whitmore leaning forward attentively, Mr. Harrison with his arms crossed but looking interested, Sarah with her hands clasped like she was praying for me.

And Derek. I could see Derek now too.

He sat utterly still, his focus absolute. Even from the stage, I could see the intensity in his gaze, the way he was absorbing every word.

He knew. Of course he knew.

I read the final section.

"*It takes courage to be vulnerable—to show someone your uncertainties and fears and dreams that might not make sense. But it also takes courage to see someone else's vulnerability. To accept that the person who challenges you might be showing love in a language you don't yet speak. To risk falling for the whole complicated person rather than hiding behind the safety of partial knowledge.*"

My voice grew stronger, more certain.

"*So here's what I've learned: People contain multitudes. The same person can be confident in public and uncertain in private, vulnerable in writing and guarded in speech, challenging and understanding simultaneously. And if you want real connection—not safe connection, but real—you have to choose to see them completely. All the contradictions, all the complexity, all the ways they don't fit into neat categories.*"

I paused, drew breath for the final lines.

"*You have to decide whether to run from that complexity or embrace it.*

*I'm choosing to embrace it.*"

The silence that followed my last word stretched for what felt like an eternity. I looked out at the audience, my heart pounding, suddenly terrified that I'd miscalculated. That it was too personal, too revealing, too much.

Then the applause started.

Not polite literary-event applause, but genuine, warm, enthusiastic clapping. Mrs. Whitmore was beaming. Mr. Harrison was nodding with what looked like approval. Sarah's hands were clasped over her heart.

And Derek—

Derek was staring at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Shock, maybe. Recognition definitely. His hands were frozen mid-clap, like he'd started to applaud on autopilot then forgotten to continue.

Even from the stage, across the distance of the auditorium, I could see the moment he understood. Really understood. That every word had been about us. About him. About me trying—finally trying—to see him wholly.

Our eyes met across the space.

I couldn't read his full expression from here. Couldn't tell if what I saw was hope or hurt or some combination. But I saw recognition. Saw him receive what I'd been trying to say.

*I see you. Compass and Derek. Vulnerable writer and challenging debater. All of it. All of you.*

The applause continued. I made myself look away from Derek, acknowledge the audience with a small smile and nod. Then I gathered my essay from the stand and walked off stage, my legs shaking.

Madison caught me in the wings, pulled me into a fierce hug. "That was perfect," she whispered. "Absolutely perfect."

But I barely heard her. My heart was still racing, adrenaline flooding my system now that the reading was over. I'd done it. I'd stood in front of the entire school and shared the most honest piece I'd ever written. Had made a public declaration of understanding, of trying, of choosing complexity over safety.

Sarah appeared next, her eyes bright. "Emma, that was incredible. I've never heard you read something so personal."

"Thanks," I managed, though my voice sounded distant to my own ears.

Because Derek had heard me. Had understood what I was really saying beneath the universal language of the essay. Had sat in that audience and received every word I'd carefully crafted to tell him: *I see you now. I'm trying. I'm choosing this.*

Now the only question was: what would he do with that understanding?
