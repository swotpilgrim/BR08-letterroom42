# Chapter 5: Correspondence Begins

The correspondence with Compass becomes the rhythm of my weeks.

Every issue cycle—two weeks from submission deadline to distribution—I wait with the kind of anticipation I used to reserve for exam results or college acceptance letters. Except this feels more important somehow. More personal.

Compass's response to my question about what he'd create arrives in the third issue. I read it standing in the mailroom, Madison hovering nearby like she's been doing since this whole thing started.

*Navigator,*

*You asked what I'd create if I weren't afraid. The answer feels almost embarrassingly earnest: I'd write philosophy essays that actually matter. Not the dry academic arguments that no one reads, but explorations of how people make choices, why we become who we become, what it means to live well.*

*And poetry. I know that's not very practical either, but I'd write poetry that examines the small moments that contain entire philosophies—how you decide whether to speak or stay silent, how you know when to hold on versus when to let go, how you live with the gap between who you are and who you want to be.*

*Basically, I want to use words to help people think more clearly about being human. Which sounds pretentious when I write it out like that, but it's the truth.*

The letter continues, responding to my thoughts about false binaries between passion and practicality, and ends with a question about what authors have shaped how I see the world.

I carry that letter with me for days, rereading it between classes, during study hall, before bed. The image of Compass—whoever he is—writing philosophy essays and poetry about human choices feels perfectly right somehow. Like of course that's what he'd create. Like I should have known.

My response comes easily. I write about the authors who've mattered to me: Virginia Woolf for showing how consciousness actually works, Ursula K. Le Guin for proving science fiction could explore human nature as deeply as any literary fiction, Toni Morrison for the way language itself can carry history and pain and beauty simultaneously.

I ask Compass about his favorite books, and when his response arrives two weeks later, I spend an entire evening comparing our lists with Madison.

"Look—he loves *The Left Hand of Darkness* too," I say, pointing at the page. "And listen to what he says about it: 'Le Guin understood that gender shapes how we think, how we move through the world, how we imagine possibility. Taking it away forces you to see the human underneath.' Isn't that exactly right?"

Madison looks up from her field hockey playbook. "You're really into this correspondence."

"It's just nice to talk to someone who cares about books the same way I do."

"Mm-hmm." Her tone suggests skepticism, but she's smiling.

The exchanges continue. Compass writes about the pressure of college applications—his parents pushing for pre-med programs while he's secretly researching schools with strong philosophy departments. I respond with my own version: the guilt of disappointing parents who've sacrificed so much, the fear that choosing passion makes me selfish.

*But what if choosing passion is actually braver than choosing safety?* Compass writes. *What if the people who tell us to be practical are the ones who were afraid to try?*

I copy that line into my journal, reading it whenever doubt creeps in.

In November, when the sixth issue comes out, Compass's letter includes a confession that makes my breath catch:

*I've never told anyone in person the things I'm telling you. I have friends, people I'm close to, but we don't talk about this stuff. We argue about books in class, compete over grades, joke around at meals. But actual feelings about what we want to become? What scares us? Never.*

*There's something about anonymity that makes honesty easier. Or maybe it's something about you specifically—the way you write makes me feel like you'd understand even the parts of myself I don't fully understand yet.*

I read that paragraph five times in a row.

"He trusts me," I tell Madison that evening. "Compass—he's never told anyone this stuff, but he's telling me."

"Because you're anonymous."

"Because we connect." I shake my head. "It's not just the anonymity. It's that we see the world the same way. We value the same things."

Madison sets down her textbook, giving me her full attention. "Emma, can I ask you something?"

"Always."

"Do you want to know who he is?"

The question hangs between us. I've been avoiding thinking about it directly, but of course I've wondered. Of course I've scanned the senior class, looking for someone who might be Compass. Someone thoughtful and literary, who quotes Le Guin and cares about philosophy and struggles with parental expectations.

"I'm curious," I admit finally. "But I also don't want to ruin what we have."

"How would knowing ruin it?"

"Because right now it's pure." I try to articulate something I've only half-formed in my own mind. "We're connecting through ideas and words, nothing else. No physical appearance, no social status, no preconceptions based on reputation or friend groups. Just what we think and how we express it."

"That's kind of beautiful, actually."

"And if I knew who he was..." I trail off. "What if knowing changed how I read the letters? What if I started seeing the person instead of the words?"

Madison considers this. "But don't you eventually want to meet him? Like, actually talk face-to-face?"

"Maybe. I don't know." I close the magazine. "For now, this feels like enough. More than enough, actually. It feels like the most real conversation I'm having with anyone."

"Hey!" Madison throws a pillow at me. "I'm right here having real conversations with you."

"You know what I mean. The most real conversation about this specific stuff—writing and dreams and all of it."

She retrieves her pillow, expression softening. "I do know. And I get why the anonymity feels safe. I just hope you're not using it to avoid actual connection, you know?"

I think about that after she's fallen asleep. Am I avoiding connection by preferring anonymous letters to face-to-face relationships? Or am I finding a different kind of connection, one that's just as valid?

The truth is that writing to Compass feels more intimate than most of my in-person interactions. When I'm writing, I can take time to find exactly the right words. I can be vulnerable without worrying about facial expressions or tone of voice betraying something I'm not ready to show. I can think through my feelings instead of reacting in the moment.

And Compass does the same. Each letter is thoughtful, carefully worded, honest in ways that would be harder face-to-face. We're showing each other our real selves—maybe more real than the selves we perform in dining halls and classrooms.

By December, I have a folder in my desk containing every letter Compass has sent. Seven exchanges, fourteen letters total if you count both his and mine. I've read them so many times I could probably recite passages from memory.

The latest arrived yesterday, responding to my letter about feeling caught between the writer I want to be and the practical person my parents need me to be.

*Navigator, I think maybe we're asking the wrong question. Instead of "How do I choose between passion and practicality," maybe we should ask "How do I build a life that honors both?" Maybe it's not about choosing one or the other. Maybe it's about finding a way to pursue what matters while also taking care of ourselves and the people we love.*

*I don't have answers. I'm still trying to figure it out myself. But talking to you—writing to you—helps me think more clearly about it. You ask questions that make me examine my assumptions. You share perspectives that challenge how I've been framing the whole dilemma.*

*This correspondence has become the best part of my week. Is that strange to say? We've never met, don't even know each other's names, but your letters feel more important than most of my "real" relationships.*

*Thank you for being brave enough to submit that first letter. Thank you for creating a space where this kind of conversation can happen.*

I trace the words with my finger, feeling something warm and complicated in my chest.

"You're reading it again," Sarah observes, entering the magazine office where I've been working on layout.

I don't bother denying it. "It's a good letter."

"Compass?" She's seen enough of my recent behavior to guess.

"Yeah."

Sarah sits on the edge of my desk. "You know half the school is trying to figure out who the regular correspondents are, right? People have theories about Navigator and Compass."

My stomach drops. "Seriously?"

"The letter exchange is the most popular feature in the magazine. People are invested in the ongoing correspondences, especially yours." She grins. "Don't worry—no one actually knows who you are. But people are definitely speculating."

"Great."

"It's good for the magazine." Sarah's tone is practical. "Engagement is way up. Submissions keep increasing. People actually read the whole thing now instead of just skimming for their friends' work."

She's right, and as editor I should be pleased about increased engagement. But there's something unsettling about knowing people are speculating about my correspondence with Compass, trying to identify us, turning our private conversation into entertainment.

"Does it bother you?" Sarah asks. "The attention?"

"It bothers me that something personal has become public spectacle."

"That's kind of the nature of publishing it in a magazine, though."

Also true. I agreed to publication when I submitted the letters. I can't be surprised that people are reading them.

But I can wish they'd treat the correspondence as what it is—two people trying to understand themselves and each other—rather than a puzzle to solve or a story to follow.

That night, writing my next letter to Compass, I almost mention the speculation. Almost write: *People are trying to figure out who we are. Does that bother you?*

But I don't. Because bringing up the outside world feels like inviting it into this space we've created, and I'm not ready for that yet.

Instead, I write about the books I'm reading for English class, about the way winter light falls across the quad, about the moment yesterday when I was writing in the library and suddenly found the exact right word for something I'd been trying to express for weeks.

I write about the small, real moments that make up a life.

And I trust that Compass will understand why those moments matter.

Because so far, he always has.
