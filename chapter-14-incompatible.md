# Chapter 14: Incompatible

After Madison's confrontation, I need to write to Compass.

Not about Madison's theory—I'm not ready to admit I might have confusing feelings for someone in my real life. But I need to process the question she raised: can someone who challenges you constantly actually be showing respect?

Sunday evening, I draft a letter without naming Derek specifically.

*Compass,*

*I've been thinking about the people who frustrate us versus the people who understand us, and whether those categories have to be mutually exclusive.*

*There's someone in my life—a classmate—who challenges everything I say. Every opinion I offer, every interpretation I make, he has a counterargument ready. At first I thought he was just being contrary for sport, enjoying intellectual combat for its own sake.*

*But recently someone suggested that maybe his challenges aren't dismissive. Maybe he engages so intensely because he actually respects my mind enough to take my ideas seriously. Maybe easy agreement would be more dismissive than rigorous debate.*

*I don't know if I buy that. It feels like rationalization for behavior that's genuinely exhausting. Why can't someone who respects you also occasionally just... agree? Why does every conversation have to be a test?*

*You and I don't interact that way. We challenge each other, yes, but it's collaborative. We're seeking understanding together, not trying to win arguments. That feels fundamentally different from constant intellectual combat.*

*Am I wrong to think that some people are just incompatible, regardless of mutual respect? That different communication styles can't always be bridged?*

*—Navigator*

I seal the letter before I can second-guess the vulnerability, the admission that I'm confused about this.

Two weeks later, Compass's response arrives.

I'm in the magazine office, working on final layout for the December issue, when Sarah brings me my copy.

"New issue's out," she says, dropping it on my desk. "Your correspondence with Compass continues to be the most popular feature, by the way. People are very invested."

I barely hear her. I'm already flipping to the letter exchange section.

*Navigator,*

*Your letter hit close to home because I've been grappling with something similar.*

*I have someone in my life—also a classmate—who I constantly disagree with. We argue about books, about interpretation, about meaning. And for a long time I thought maybe I was just being difficult, enjoying argument too much.*

*But here's what I've realized: I don't argue like that with everyone. I save my real engagement for people whose minds I respect enough to challenge. People who can push back, who make me defend my positions, who refuse to just accept what I say without examination.*

*Your classmate might be the same way. Maybe he challenges you specifically because he thinks you're worth the effort. Because easy agreement would mean he doesn't value your intellect enough to really engage with it.*

*That doesn't mean it's not exhausting. Believe me, I understand that the person I argue with finds it frustrating sometimes. But from my perspective, those debates are the most meaningful interactions I have. They make me think more clearly than any easy conversation ever has.*

*As for whether some people are just incompatible—maybe. Or maybe we're incompatible in ways that paradoxically make us good for each other. Maybe the person who understands us through letters and the person who challenges us in real life are both valuable, just differently.*

*I'm probably overthinking this. Or maybe I'm just defending my own argumentative tendencies because your letter made me uncomfortably self-aware.*

*Does that help? Or did I just rationalize the exact behavior you find frustrating?*

*—Compass*

I read the letter three times.

There's something in Compass's response that feels... off. Not wrong exactly, but uncomfortably specific. Like he's not just answering my question but confessing something personal.

"You okay?" Sarah asks, noticing my expression.

"Yeah. Just—Compass's response is more defensive than usual."

"Defensive how?"

I reread the relevant passage. "I asked about whether constant challenge can coexist with respect. And he basically argued yes, from the perspective of being the challenger. Like he's the person who exhausts someone else with arguments."

"Interesting." Sarah leans over to read. "So Compass has a classmate he argues with too?"

"Apparently. A female classmate, based on pronouns." I trace the words with my finger. "He says arguing with her is his most meaningful interaction. That the debates make him think more clearly."

"That's actually kind of sweet. In an argumentative way."

But it makes me uneasy. The parallel between my situation with Derek and Compass's situation with his unnamed classmate feels too close. Both of us frustrated by people who challenge us, both grappling with whether that challenge might be something other than pure antagonism.

I draft my response that evening, sitting at my desk while Madison studies across the room.

*Compass,*

*Your letter was thoughtful, as always. And maybe you're right that some people show respect through rigorous engagement rather than easy agreement.*

*But I think there's a difference between collaborative challenge and constant combat. Between someone who pushes you to think more clearly and someone who just can't let anything go uncontested.*

*The classmate I mentioned—he's brilliant, I'll give him that. And maybe there's some respect underneath the arguments. But it doesn't feel like understanding. It feels like performance. Like he's more interested in being right than in actually connecting.*

*You and I connect differently. Through vulnerability and honesty, through questions rather than declarations. That feels more real to me than any amount of intellectual sparring.*

*So maybe some people are just fundamentally different in how they communicate. Maybe the person who argues constantly and the person who shares honestly through letters are incompatible types. Not bad, just... incompatible.*

*Does that make sense?*

*—Navigator*

I seal the letter and drop it in the submission box Monday morning.

But I can't shake the feeling that Compass's response revealed something I wasn't ready to see.

The next issue arrives two weeks later.

I collect it from my mailbox during lunch, flip immediately to the letter exchange section, and find Compass's response shorter than usual.

*Navigator,*

*You're probably right about incompatibility. Some communication styles don't mesh, regardless of good intentions.*

*I've been thinking about what you said—that connection through letters feels more real than intellectual sparring. Maybe you're right. Maybe the person who shares vulnerability honestly is fundamentally different from the person who engages through debate.*

*I just wonder sometimes if they have to be mutually exclusive. If someone can be both—vulnerable in writing, challenging in person. If different contexts bring out different sides.*

*But maybe that's wishful thinking. Maybe you can't really know someone who only shows you one version of themselves.*

*This response probably isn't helpful. I'm questioning my own assumptions instead of answering your question.*

*—Compass*

I read it sitting in the magazine office, long after the lunch period has ended.

There's something underneath Compass's words. Something uncertain, almost sad. Like he's grappling with a question bigger than the one I asked.

The phrase "if someone can be both—vulnerable in writing, challenging in person" sits uncomfortably in my chest.

As if Compass is asking whether he could be both. Whether Navigator could accept both sides of him.

But that's reading too much into it. Compass doesn't know I'm Navigator. He's speaking generally, not specifically about us.

Still.

I reread the letter a fifth time, trying to identify what feels wrong.

*Maybe you can't really know someone who only shows you one version of themselves.*

Is Compass saying I only know one version of him? That the person in the letters isn't the complete picture?

Or is he saying he only knows one version of me?

Mrs. Whitmore enters the office, interrupting my spiraling thoughts.

"Emma, dear. You look troubled."

I set down the magazine. "Just thinking about a letter exchange."

"Compass?" She's seen enough of my behavior to guess.

"He wrote something that feels... I don't know. Uncertain. Like he's questioning whether our connection is real."

Mrs. Whitmore settles into the chair across from my desk. "Anonymous correspondence is complicated. You build intimacy through words but miss all the context that comes from physical presence and real-time interaction."

"But isn't that purer? Connection based on ideas instead of superficial factors?"

"Pure, maybe. But also incomplete." She pauses. "Emma, have you considered that whoever Compass is might also be someone you interact with in real life? That you might know them already but not recognize them?"

The question echoes Madison's suggestion.

"I'd recognize how someone thinks," I insist. "Compass has a specific voice, specific concerns. If I knew him in person, I'd see the parallels."

"Would you? If you'd already decided they were one type of person, would you notice evidence to the contrary?"

That's the second time someone's suggested I might be blind to the obvious.

"I think I'd notice," I say, but I'm less certain than I want to be.

After Mrs. Whitmore leaves, I sit alone in the office, rereading Compass's letter.

The uncertainty in his words. The question about whether someone can be both vulnerable and challenging. The suggestion that I might only know one version of him.

If Compass is someone I know, who could he be?

Not Derek. That's impossible. Derek is all intellectual combat, all sarcasm and argument. Nothing like Compass's thoughtful vulnerability.

But Madison's voice echoes: *Maybe debate is Derek's love language.*

And Compass's words: *Vulnerable in writing, challenging in person.*

No.

Derek and Compass are fundamentally different types of people. Incompatible communication styles, just like I wrote.

They can't be the same person.

Can they?

I push the thought away.

But it doesn't leave.
