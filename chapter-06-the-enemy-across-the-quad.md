# Chapter 6: The Enemy Across the Quad

Windermere is a small campus, which means avoiding someone is basically impossible.

Not that I'm trying to avoid Derek Lane specifically. I'm just increasingly aware that our paths cross with annoying regularity, and each encounter seems designed to irritate me.

Monday morning, mailroom. I'm juggling an armful of books—two for English, one for history, my journal, and a copy of the magazine I'm delivering to Mrs. Whitmore—when Derek appears beside me.

"Need help, Sullivan?" His tone suggests amusement rather than genuine concern.

"I'm fine."

A book starts to slip. I catch it awkwardly, which makes another one tilt. Derek reaches out and steadies the stack before it can tumble completely.

"Thanks," I mutter.

"Impressive organizational skills for an editor." He holds the door open as we exit. "Really inspiring confidence in the magazine's future."

I shoot him a look. "Some of us actually read books instead of just arguing about them."

"Who says I don't read them?" He grins. "I just happen to also enjoy discussing them. Rigorously."

"Is that what you call it?"

"What would you call it?"

"Being contrary for sport."

His grin widens. "Now who's being contrary?"

I don't have a response to that, which only makes his expression more satisfied. He waves as he heads toward Bancroft Hall, and I continue to the academic building wondering why a simple conversation with Derek Lane always leaves me feeling like I lost an argument I didn't realize I was having.

Dining hall, Tuesday evening. The Ashford Hall tables are directly adjacent to the Bancroft section, which means I spend every meal within full view of Derek and his friends. It's one of Windermere's traditions I could do without—assigned seating by dorm means I can't escape the Bancroft boys even during meals.

Usually I can ignore them. Tonight I'm discussing the letter exchange with Madison, trying to eat while she insists people are shipping various correspondent pairs, when Andrew Mitchell—Derek's roommate from Room 42—catches my eye and waves. I wave back because Andrew is actually nice, unlike his argumentative friend.

"Sullivan!" Andrew calls across the gap between tables. "Tell Derek that *The Great Gatsby* is obviously a critique of the American Dream. He's being difficult about it."

I glance at Derek, who's leaning back in his chair with an expression of exaggerated innocence.

"I'm not being difficult," Derek says. "I'm pointing out that Fitzgerald's relationship with the American Dream is more complicated than simple critique. He's both criticizing it and seduced by it."

Against my better judgment, I respond. "You can be seduced by something and still recognize it's hollow. That's literally Nick's whole arc."

"But Gatsby himself never recognizes it's hollow. He dies believing. So who's perspective matters more—Nick's educated cynicism or Gatsby's romantic faith?"

"Nick's, because he's the narrator and Fitzgerald's proxy—"

"Is he though?" Derek leans forward now, warming to the argument. "Or is Nick just another character whose perspective is limited?"

I realize I've been pulled into exactly the kind of debate Derek excels at—the kind where there's no clear answer, just increasingly complex questions. Around us, both tables have gone quiet, watching our exchange like it's entertainment.

"This is why you're exhausting," I say finally. "You can't just let someone have a straightforward interpretation."

"Where's the fun in that?"

Madison, sitting beside me, makes a noise that might be a laugh or a cough. I kick her under the table.

Derek's friend Andrew is definitely laughing. "You two should just admit you enjoy arguing with each other."

"We don't," I say firmly, at the same time Derek says, "Speak for yourself."

I glare at him. He raises his water glass in a mock toast.

After dinner, Madison links her arm through mine as we walk back to the dorm. "You know Andrew might have a point."

"About what?"

"About you and Derek enjoying the arguments."

"I definitely don't enjoy them."

"You engaged with his *Gatsby* question instead of ignoring him."

"Because he was wrong about Nick being just another limited character—"

"See?" Madison's smile is knowing. "You're still arguing even though he's not here."

I force myself to stop talking.

But she's not entirely wrong. I do keep mentally continuing the debate, thinking of better counterpoints I could have made. Which is irritating precisely because Derek is very good at finding the complicated angle in any discussion, the question that doesn't have an easy answer.

Wednesday afternoon, library. I'm working with Sarah and two other magazine staff members at one of the large tables, editing submissions for the next issue. We're debating whether a particular poem's ending works when Derek slides into a chair two tables over.

He's alone, which is unusual. Usually he's with Andrew or other Bancroft guys. He pulls out what looks like a philosophy textbook and notebook, settles in, and appears to be actually studying.

I try to ignore him and focus on Sarah's question about the poem's final stanza.

"I think it works," Sarah says. "The ambiguity is intentional—"

"The ambiguity is lazy," Derek calls over. "If you can't commit to a meaning, maybe you haven't earned the poem yet."

We all turn to stare at him.

"Were you listening to our conversation?" I ask.

"You're not exactly whispering, Sullivan." He doesn't look up from his book. "And I'm offering valuable editorial feedback."

"We didn't ask for your feedback."

"Free of charge anyway." Now he does look up, eyebrows raised. "Unless you think ambiguity in endings is always a strength?"

"I think sometimes trusting your reader to sit with uncertainty is braver than spelling everything out."

"Or it's avoiding the hard work of finding the right ending."

Sarah and the others are watching us like we're a tennis match again. I feel my face heat.

"Don't you have your own work to do?" I gesture at his textbook.

"Multitasking." He returns to his reading, but there's a slight smile on his face that makes me want to throw my pencil at him.

We try to return to our discussion, but I'm hyperaware of Derek's presence now. Aware that he might be listening, might interject with another "helpful" observation designed to undermine whatever point I'm making.

After twenty minutes, Sarah suggests we move to the magazine office for more privacy. Everyone agrees with meaningful looks in Derek's direction.

As we pack up, Derek says, without looking up, "For what it's worth, I think you should keep the ambiguous ending. Trusting readers is underrated."

I pause, caught off guard. "Then why did you argue the opposite?"

"To see if you'd defend your position." Now he looks at me. "You did. Good editorial instinct."

I don't know what to say to that. Is he complimenting me or mocking me or simply being Derek, who apparently can't have a straightforward conversation about anything?

"Thanks," I manage finally. "I think."

His smile is brief but genuine before he returns to his textbook.

That evening, I'm complaining to Madison about Derek's library commentary when she interrupts.

"Okay, but did you notice he agreed with you in the end?"

"After arguing the opposite for ten minutes."

"Because he wanted to see you defend your position." Madison sets down her field hockey playbook. "That's actually kind of sweet."

"It's annoying."

"It's both." She gives me a look. "Emma, Derek Lane is consistently one of the top students in our class. He's not stupid. He's not arguing just to be difficult."

I flop onto my bed. "Then why does he argue?"

"Maybe because he likes engaging with people who can keep up with him intellectually. And maybe because you're one of the few people who actually does."

I consider this. It's true that Derek doesn't bother debating with everyone—he mostly saves his arguments for class discussions or, apparently, for me. And he is genuinely smart. His points about Wordsworth's philosophical structure and Fitzgerald's complicated relationship with the American Dream were actually insightful, even if I didn't want to admit it at the time.

"He's still irritating," I insist.

"Sure. But irritating and interesting aren't mutually exclusive."

"Whose side are you on?"

"Yours, always." Madison's expression softens. "I'm just saying maybe Derek isn't quite the enemy you've made him out to be."

I think about that after Madison falls asleep. About the way Derek held the door while making a joke about my book-juggling, about Andrew clearly being friends with him despite (or because of) his argumentative nature, about the moment in the library when he told me to trust my editorial instinct.

The thing is, I can admit Derek is smart. Brilliant, even, based on how Mr. Harrison lights up when Derek contributes to discussions. And Madison has a point that he doesn't waste time arguing with people he doesn't respect intellectually.

But that doesn't make him less exhausting to deal with on a daily basis.

Maybe he's not an enemy exactly.

But he's definitely not someone I understand. Derek treats everything—books, ideas, apparently even editorial decisions—like puzzles to solve through debate. He uses intelligence as both shield and weapon, keeping people at a distance while simultaneously engaging with them intensely.

It's exhausting. And confusing. And completely unlike the way Compass approaches conversation—thoughtful, vulnerable, genuinely seeking understanding rather than intellectual combat.

The contrast is striking. Compass writes about finding meaning and building a life that honors both passion and practicality. Derek argues about whether Nick Carraway is Fitzgerald's proxy or just another limited character.

Two completely different ways of moving through the world.

I'm grateful that even though Derek is unavoidable on a small campus, I have Compass's letters to balance out all the argumentative energy. I have someone who actually wants to understand, not just debate.

That's worth more than all the intellectual sparring in the world.
