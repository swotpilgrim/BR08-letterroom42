# Chapter 4: Compass Responds

The new issue of *The Windermere Review* arrives on Thursday morning.

I helped Sarah distribute them before breakfast, sliding copies into mailboxes with nervous energy. Somewhere in that stack is my letter—Navigator's letter—and possibly a response.

Or possibly nothing.

I force myself to wait until after breakfast to check. Madison watches me push eggs around my plate and wisely doesn't comment.

"I'm getting the new issue," I announce, standing abruptly.

"I'll come with you."

"You don't have to—"

"Emma." Madison's tone is patient. "I'm coming with you."

The mailroom is crowded with students collecting copies. Sarah catches my eye from across the room and grins enthusiastically.

I spin my combination lock with clumsy fingers, pull out the magazine, and flip immediately to the letter exchange section.

It's expanded this issue—three full pages instead of one. Student response exceeded our hopes. Letters fill the section, some standalone, others clearly responses.

I scan for Navigator's pseudonym.

And there it is.

My letter, printed in the clean typeface we use for all submissions, followed immediately by a response from someone who signed themselves "Compass."

My heart thuds against my ribs.

"Well?" Madison asks quietly.

"Someone responded."

I read Compass's letter standing right there in the mailroom, Madison peering over my shoulder.

*Navigator,*

*I read your letter three times before I understood why it affected me so much. You articulated something I've been struggling to put into words for years.*

*I have parents who want security for me, who see creative pursuits as hobbies rather than callings. They're not cruel about it—they're loving, practical people who want me to have opportunities they didn't. But they've already planned my future: practical degree, practical career, practical life. When I try to explain that I want something different, I can see the worry in their faces. The disappointment.*

*You asked if it's selfish to choose passion over practicality. I think maybe the question itself is the problem. Who decided those were the only two options? Who said that creating meaning and providing security had to be mutually exclusive?*

*Maybe the people who tell us to be practical are the ones who gave up on their own dreams and need us to validate that choice by making the same one. Maybe they're not happier for being practical—maybe they're just resigned.*

*Or maybe I'm just trying to justify wanting what I want instead of what I should want.*

*Here's what I do know: you asked how to choose between who you are and who you're supposed to be. But aren't you already choosing by asking the question? People who are content being what others expect don't lie awake wondering about it.*

*What would you write if you knew you couldn't fail?*

*—Compass*

I read it again. Then a third time.

"Emma?" Madison's voice seems to come from far away. "You okay?"

"He understands." My voice sounds strange to my own ears. "Whoever this is—he actually understands."

Madison gently takes the magazine from my hands and reads the letter herself. When she looks up, her expression is soft.

"That's a really thoughtful response."

"It's more than thoughtful." I take the magazine back, reading one more time. "He's not just sympathizing. He's actually grappling with the same thing. The exact same tension between passion and expectation."

The question sits in my chest: *What would you write if you knew you couldn't fail?*

Nobody's ever asked me that. Everyone asks what makes sense, what's realistic. But what would I write if failure wasn't possible?

Novels. Stories about real people navigating being human. The things that matter—connection and loss and becoming someone different than you thought you'd be. Books that made me feel less alone, hoping they might do the same for someone else.

"I need to respond," I say suddenly.

Madison checks her watch. "You have English in fifteen minutes."

"I need to respond," I repeat.

She knows better than to argue when I get like this. "Library after class?"

"Yes. Perfect."

I carry the magazine to English like it's something precious, tucking it carefully into my bag. All through Mr. Harrison's discussion of Blake's "The Tyger," I'm only half-present. My mind is already drafting responses, turning over Compass's question, trying to articulate what I'd create if I knew I couldn't fail.

Derek Lane makes some argument about the theological implications of the poem that I would normally engage with, but today I just nod vaguely and let someone else debate him. Charlotte looks surprised when I don't jump in. So does Derek, based on the curious glance he throws my way.

But I don't care about debates right now. I care about getting to the library and finding the words to respond to someone who actually understands.

The moment class ends, I'm out the door.

The library is quiet mid-morning, most students still in classes. I claim a table in the back corner near the literature section—my favorite spot, surrounded by the spines of books that have kept me company through four years at Windermere.

I pull out my journal and the magazine, reading Compass's letter one more time before I start writing.

*Compass,*

*Your question has been echoing in my head since I read it this morning. What would I write if I knew I couldn't fail?*

*I'd write novels. Real ones, the kind that try to capture what it actually feels like to be alive. I'd write about ordinary people facing the moments that change them—not huge dramatic events necessarily, but the quiet revelations that shift how you see the world. I'd write about friendship and family and the terrifying vulnerability of letting someone actually know you.*

*I'd write about the things I observe every day in a place like this—how we perform versions of ourselves in public, how we're all terrified of not being enough, how sometimes the person sitting across from you in the dining hall is fighting battles you can't see. I'd write books that make people feel less alone.*

*But you're right about the question being the problem. I've been so focused on the binary—practical or passionate—that I haven't stopped to ask if that's a false choice. Maybe there's a way to pursue writing that doesn't mean abandoning security entirely. Maybe there's a path I haven't considered because I've been too afraid to look for it.*

*You said maybe the people who tell us to be practical gave up on their own dreams and need us to validate that choice. I think you're partly right. But I also think they genuinely believe they're protecting us from disappointment. They see the world as harder than we do, more likely to crush dreamers. They're not wrong that it's difficult. They're just wrong that difficult means impossible.*

*At least, I hope they're wrong about that.*

*Thank you for responding. Thank you for understanding. I've never told anyone these things except my roommate, and even with her I sometimes feel like I'm burdening her with worries she doesn't share. Reading your letter made me realize I'm not alone in this struggle.*

*What are you afraid of creating? You asked what I'd write, but you didn't say what you'd make if failure wasn't possible.*

*—Navigator*

I read it over, checking for anything too identifying. It's honest without being specific about my life at Windermere. Vulnerable without revealing who I am.

Good enough.

I copy it carefully onto clean paper, fold it, and head to the third floor to submit it to the drop box.

This time, there's no hesitation. I slip the letter through the slot and feel something that might be excitement or anticipation or the beginning of connection with someone I've never met.

That evening, Madison finds me in our dorm room reading Compass's letter for probably the tenth time.

"You're smiling at a magazine," she observes, dropping her field hockey gear in the corner. "That's either really good or really concerning."

"His response was perfect." I hold up the magazine. "Not perfect like flawless—perfect like honest and thoughtful and asking questions that actually matter."

Madison sits on her bed, pulling off her cleats. "So mystery correspondent is a he?"

"The letter feels male, but I guess I don't know for sure." I consider it. "Does it matter?"

"I don't know. Does it?"

I think about that. The truth is, I've been picturing Compass as male—partly because of the writing style, partly because of some indefinable quality in the words. But Madison's right that I don't actually know.

"No," I decide. "What matters is that he—or she, or they—understands. That's rarer than it should be."

"What did you say in your response?"

I tell her about the novels I'd write, about questioning the practical-versus-passionate binary, about asking Compass what he's afraid of creating.

Madison listens, her expression thoughtful. "You know what's interesting? You're more animated talking about this letter exchange than you've been about anything all year except the magazine itself."

"Because it's the first real conversation I've had about this stuff with someone who gets it."

"I get it."

"You do," I agree quickly. "But you don't struggle with it the same way. You're comfortable with your path—field hockey, probably education major, coaching eventually. You've figured out how to want something that also makes sense to everyone else."

Madison nods slowly. "Fair. I guess I forget how much harder it is when what you want doesn't fit anyone's definition of reasonable."

"Compass gets that. Whoever they are, they're living the same tension."

"So you're going to keep writing to them?"

"If they keep responding." I set the magazine down. "Is that weird? Carrying on a correspondence with someone whose identity I don't know?"

"It's very romantic in a Jane Austen kind of way."

"It's not romantic," I protest. "It's just—connection. Through words. That's different."

Madison's smile suggests she's not entirely convinced, but she doesn't push it.

Later, after lights out, I think about Compass's question. *What would you write if you knew you couldn't fail?*

The question assumes possibility. Assumes the only thing stopping me is fear, not lack of talent or impossibility itself.

What if Compass is right? What if fear is the real obstacle?

Somewhere in this school, Compass is probably thinking similar questions. Wondering what they'd create if they were brave enough. Carrying the same weight of expectations and the terrifying hope that maybe pursuing passion isn't impossible.

I don't know who Compass is. Don't know what they look like or whether I've ever spoken to them.

But I know they understand. And right now, that's enough.
