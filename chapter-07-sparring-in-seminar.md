# Chapter 7: Sparring in Seminar

Mr. Harrison's senior English seminar meets in a room that feels more like a library reading room than a classroom.

Instead of the typical rows of desks, we sit around a large oak table that seats twelve. Wooden bookshelves line the walls, filled with annotated editions and critical texts. Tall windows let in morning light that makes dust motes visible in the air. It's intimate in a way that regular classrooms aren't—there's nowhere to hide, no back row to disappear into. Everything we say is visible to everyone else.

This is the kind of environment Derek Lane thrives in.

I settle into my usual seat—midway down the left side of the table—and pull out my worn copy of *Pride and Prejudice*. We've been working through it for two weeks, and today Mr. Harrison wants to discuss the resolution. I have thoughts. Strong thoughts, actually, about how Austen crafts Elizabeth and Darcy's growth arcs.

Derek arrives just before class starts, sliding into his seat across and two down from me. He's already flipping through his book, pages tagged with at least a dozen sticky notes. Of course he has sticky notes. Derek approaches literature like a lawyer preparing a case.

"Good morning." Mr. Harrison closes the classroom door and takes his place at the head of the table. "We're talking about endings today. Specifically, the question of whether Austen gives us a romance or a social critique. Or both. Or something else entirely."

He looks around the table, inviting someone to start. I raise my hand.

"I think the romance is the vehicle for the social critique," I say. "Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship only works because they both overcome their pride and prejudice—their personal growth is the story. The social commentary about class and economics is there, but it's secondary to the character development."

"Interesting." Mr. Harrison nods. "Anyone want to respond?"

Derek's hand goes up. Of course it does.

"I'd argue the opposite," he says. "The romance is window dressing for what's fundamentally an economic and social calculation. Elizabeth marries Darcy because he's rich and powerful. He marries her because she's witty and pretty. The 'growth' is both of them learning to see past surface objections to a mutually beneficial arrangement."

I feel my jaw tighten. "That's incredibly cynical and misses the entire emotional arc."

"Does it?" Derek leans forward slightly. "Elizabeth refuses Darcy's first proposal specifically because of his pride and her prejudice. But her mind changes primarily after seeing Pemberley and learning about his character from his housekeeper. That's economic and social reality influencing romantic feeling."

"She changes her mind because she sees evidence that contradicts her prejudice," I counter. "Pemberley isn't about his wealth—it's about the way he runs his estate, how he treats people, the proof that he's not the arrogant person she thought he was."

"But why does she need proof? Because she realizes refusing ten thousand a year might have been hasty."

"Or because she's intellectually honest enough to revise her opinion when presented with new evidence!" My voice is sharper than I intended.

Around the table, other students are watching with interest. Sarah catches my eye and grins. Charlotte Reynolds looks between Derek and me like she's not sure whether to be amused or concerned.

Mr. Harrison clearly falls on the amused side. "Both interpretations are defensible. Emma, you're reading it as primarily a romance with social context. Derek, you're reading it as primarily social commentary with romantic context. What evidence supports each reading?"

I flip to a tagged passage. "Chapter 58. Elizabeth explicitly tells Darcy that her feelings changed gradually after reading his letter—the one explaining his actions regarding Wickham. That's emotional growth prompted by understanding, not by economic calculation."

"But the letter itself is Darcy performing wealth and status," Derek responds. "He's demonstrating he's the kind of man who protects his sister, manages his estate responsibly, acts honorably. That's advertising his value as a marriage prospect."

"Not everything is a transaction!"

"I'm not saying it's cold-blooded. I'm saying Austen understands that economics and emotion aren't separate. They're intertwined."

"Then you agree the emotions matter—"

"I agree they're part of a larger social calculation that Austen is brilliantly exposing."

I take a breath, trying to organize my thoughts. Derek has a way of shifting the argument just when I think I've cornered him, opening up new angles that require different responses.

"Look," I say, forcing my voice to stay level. "The whole point of Elizabeth's character is that she refuses to marry for economics alone. She turns down Mr. Collins despite the security it would provide. She resists pressure from her family and society. Her growth arc is learning to distinguish genuine worth from performance, real feeling from attraction to status. That's romantic development."

"Turning down Mr. Collins costs her nothing because she has other prospects. And yes, she learns to distinguish worth from performance—but what she determines to be 'worth' conveniently aligns with a man who owns half of Derbyshire."

"You're being deliberately reductive."

"I'm being honest about what the text shows us. Austen isn't naive about how marriage and economics work. She's writing about how women navigate a system where romantic choices are always economic choices."

"That doesn't mean the romance is less real!"

"I'm not saying it's less real. I'm saying it's more complicated than you're allowing."

Mr. Harrison raises a hand. "This is excellent. Let me ask the class—who finds Emma's reading more convincing? Who finds Derek's more convincing?"

Hands go up on both sides, roughly split. Some students offer nuanced takes that try to synthesize both views. A girl named Rachel makes a good point about Austen using irony to undercut both pure romance and pure economics, suggesting the author's position is more subtle than either extreme.

But I'm barely listening because I'm still mentally arguing with Derek. Still finding the counterpoints I should have made, the passages I should have cited, the ways I could have better defended my interpretation.

"The thing you're missing," I say, interrupting Rachel—which I feel bad about, but I need to say this—"is that Elizabeth's internal monologue in the final chapters is entirely about her feelings. About shame at her previous blindness, gratitude for his continued regard, hope that his feelings haven't changed. That's not economic calculation. That's emotion."

Derek doesn't miss a beat. "Or it's Austen showing us how Elizabeth has internalized and romanticized what is fundamentally a practical choice. The genius of the novel is making us feel the romance while showing us the economics."

"You're impossible."

"I'm thorough."

"You're deliberately contrarian."

"I'm engaging with the complexity of the text instead of settling for the easy reading."

The bell rings before I can formulate a response to that.

Mr. Harrison looks delighted. "Wonderful discussion, everyone. For next class, I want you to write a page on whether Austen resolves the tension between romance and economics or leaves it deliberately unresolved. Use textual evidence."

Students start packing up. I shove my book into my bag with more force than necessary, still mentally churning through arguments.

"Great debate, Emma." Charlotte appears beside me, but she's looking at Derek. "You too, Derek. I love when you two go at it."

Derek glances at me, something unreadable in his expression. "Sullivan makes it easy. She actually defends her positions instead of just folding."

I don't know if that's a compliment or not.

Charlotte smiles at him. "We should discuss the assignment together sometime. I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on the economics angle."

"Sure," Derek says easily.

I pretend to be very focused on organizing my bag.

After Charlotte leaves, Sarah waits for me by the door. "That was intense."

"He's frustrating."

"He's engaged."

"With being contrary."

"With you," Sarah corrects. "Emma, Derek doesn't debate like that with everyone. He saves the real arguments for you."

"Lucky me."

Sarah laughs, linking her arm through mine as we head to the dining hall. "You know what's funny? You're smiling."

"I'm not." But I am, slightly. The kind of smile that comes from intellectual engagement, from the satisfaction of a real argument even when you're frustrated by your opponent.

I force my expression neutral.

---

For the rest of the day, I keep mentally continuing the debate. Walking between classes, I think of passages that support the primacy of emotional development. Eating lunch, I consider whether Derek might have a point about the intertwining of economics and feeling. Sitting in history, I'm barely paying attention because I'm too busy formulating the perfect synthesis of both positions that would have ended the argument definitively.

"You're doing it again," Madison observes that evening in our dorm room.

"Doing what?"

"Mentally arguing with Derek hours after class ended."

I close my journal, where I've been writing notes for Mr. Harrison's assignment. "I'm working on the homework."

"You're still debating Pride and Prejudice economics versus romance, which means you're still debating Derek." Madison sets down her own homework. "Emma, this is the third time this week you've spent hours thinking about something Derek said in class."

"He's wrong about Austen—"

"Maybe. Maybe not. But why do you care so much?"

I open my mouth to explain that I care about correct literary interpretation, about defending positions I believe in, about not letting Derek's contrarian approach go unchallenged.

But Madison is looking at me with that patient expression that means she's waiting for me to figure out what she's already figured out.

"I don't know," I say finally. "He just—gets under my skin."

"Clearly." Her tone is dry. "The question is why."

I don't have a good answer to that.

That night, I lie in bed thinking about the seminar. About the way Derek leaned forward when the argument intensified, his attention completely focused, his questions genuinely challenging rather than dismissive. About the moment when he said I defended my positions instead of folding—was that respect? Acknowledgment?

About the fact that Charlotte offered to study with him and he agreed, easily, like it was nothing.

Which it was nothing. It's none of my business who Derek studies with.

I roll over, pulling my blanket up. Tomorrow there will be a new issue of the magazine, which means a new letter from Compass. That's what matters—someone who discusses ideas thoughtfully instead of combatively, who seeks understanding instead of intellectual victory.

But sleep doesn't come easily.

And when it does, I dream about oak tables and afternoon light and the satisfaction of an argument that has no clear winner.
