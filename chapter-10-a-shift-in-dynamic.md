# Chapter 10: A Shift in Dynamic

Mr. Harrison's class is discussing e.e. cummings when I first notice that something has changed.

We're analyzing "somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond," and Mr. Harrison asks us to consider whether cummings's unconventional punctuation and spacing enhances or distracts from the emotional content of the poem.

I raise my hand. "I think the form is inseparable from the content. The lack of capitals, the unusual spacing—it makes you slow down, pay attention to each word differently. It creates intimacy through disruption."

Derek, across the table, leans forward. Here it comes—the challenge, the counterargument, the systematic dismantling of my interpretation.

"I'd argue the opposite," he starts, and I brace myself. But then something in his expression shifts. There's a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Or actually, no. I wouldn't argue the opposite because you're absolutely right about the slowing down part."

I blink, surprised.

"But," Derek continues, and there it is—the inevitable but—"I think there's more to it than just intimacy. The form also creates vulnerability. By breaking conventional rules, cummings forces both himself and the reader into uncertain territory. You don't know how to read it at first, just like you don't know how to navigate the feelings he's describing."

That's... actually a really good point. And he's building on my interpretation rather than dismantling it.

"So the formal disruption mirrors emotional disruption," I say slowly.

"Exactly." Derek's smile widens slightly. "The poem is about being undone by love. The form shows that undoing happening on the page."

"That's brilliant," I admit before I can stop myself.

"You set it up. I just followed through."

Around the table, other students are watching our exchange with interest. But this time it doesn't feel like watching a debate. It feels like they're watching a collaboration.

The discussion continues, other students contributing thoughts about cummings's other poems. But I keep glancing at Derek, trying to figure out what's different. The intellectual engagement is still there. The challenge is still there. But the edge is gone, replaced by something that feels almost... playful?

Mr. Harrison brings up another poem—"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in"—and asks about the relationship between form and meaning.

"The parenthetical structure creates containment," I offer. "Like the speaker is literally holding the beloved's heart within his own syntax."

Derek nods, then adds, "And the way the lines nest inside each other, the repetition of 'i carry'—it's both possessive and protective. Ownership that's also care."

"You could read it as claustrophobic though," I counter, warming to the discussion. "All that containment, that insistence on carrying someone else's heart. It's intense to the point of being overwhelming."

"True." Derek tilts his head thoughtfully. "But isn't that kind of the point of the poem? Love as this overwhelming, all-consuming thing that you choose anyway?"

"Fair enough, Sullivan," I say, echoing the phrase he used earlier.

Derek grins outright at that.

The class ends too quickly. I'm packing up my books, still mentally turning over Derek's points about vulnerability and formal disruption, when I realize he's waiting by the door.

"Good class," he says as I approach.

"Yeah. It was."

He holds the door open. As I pass through, our eyes meet for a brief moment. There's something in his expression I can't quite read—amusement? Interest? Something else?

I look away first, suddenly flustered.

"See you at lunch, Sullivan," Derek says, and there's a warmth in his voice that wasn't there before.

"Yeah. See you."

I walk toward the dining hall in a slight daze.

"You're smiling," Madison observes at lunch.

"Am I?"

"You are. You've been smiling since you sat down." She points her fork at me. "What happened?"

"Nothing. Just... English was good today."

"English class made you smile like that?" Madison's eyebrows raise. "What were you discussing?"

"e.e. cummings. Poetry. The relationship between form and content."

"Uh-huh. And did this discussion involve a certain argumentative boy from Bancroft Hall?"

I feel my face heat. "Derek was in class, yes."

"And?"

"And nothing. We discussed the poems. He made some good points. I made some good points. It was a productive discussion."

Madison is definitely smiling now. "Emma, you enjoy arguing with him."

"I don't—" I stop myself. Because the truth is, today I did enjoy it. Enjoyed the back-and-forth, the way we built on each other's ideas, the moment when he grinned at my "Fair enough, Sullivan" callback.

"Okay, maybe I didn't completely hate today's discussion," I concede.

"Character development!" Madison mock-applauds.

"It doesn't mean anything. We just had a better discussion than usual."

"Because Derek was being less antagonistic?"

I think about that. "More collaborative, maybe. Like he was engaging with my ideas instead of just challenging them for sport."

"Interesting." Madison returns to her lunch, but I can tell she's filing this information away.

I should let it go. It was one class discussion that went better than usual. It doesn't change the fundamental dynamic between Derek and me.

Except I keep replaying moments from class in my mind. The way Derek smiled when I called his point brilliant. The way he built on my interpretation instead of dismantling it. The warmth in his voice when he said goodbye.

And the fact that I enjoyed it. Not just tolerated it, not just survived another debate—actually enjoyed the exchange.

That afternoon in the magazine office, Sarah notices my distraction.

"You okay? You've been staring at that poem submission for ten minutes without reading it."

I shake myself back to focus. "Sorry. Mind wandering."

"Anywhere interesting?"

"Just thinking about class discussions. Interpretations. The usual."

Sarah grins. "Let me guess—Derek Lane said something that's still rattling around in your brain?"

"Why does everyone assume everything is about Derek?"

"Because you talk about him constantly?" Sarah's tone is gentle. "Emma, you do realize that half our office conversations involve you processing something Derek said or arguing with an argument he made or defending a position you took against him?"

I set down the submission. "Do I really talk about him that much?"

"Not in a bad way. Just in a very obvious way." Sarah leans against my desk. "Madison thinks you're into him."

"Madison thinks everyone is into everyone."

"Is she wrong?"

The question sits between us. I think about Derek's grin this morning. About the warmth in his eyes when they met mine. About the satisfaction of a discussion that felt collaborative instead of combative.

About the way my heartbeat picked up when he held the door.

"He's not—" I stop, trying to find the right words. "Derek is all intellectual games and sarcasm. He's arguments for their own sake. He's... not genuine the way Compass is."

"Compass again." Sarah's expression is thoughtful. "You know you're comparing every real-life interaction to an anonymous correspondence, right? That's not really fair to either."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean Compass gets to be perfect on paper. He has time to compose thoughtful responses, to present his best self. Derek is right there in front of you, unfiltered, engaging in real time. They're different contexts."

I hadn't thought about it that way.

"Compass is genuine," I insist.

"I'm sure he is. I'm just saying Derek might also be genuine, even if he expresses it differently." Sarah pauses. "Has it occurred to you that maybe the argumentative thing is Derek's way of connecting? That maybe he debates with you specifically because he finds you interesting?"

"Madison said something similar."

"Because it's obviously true to everyone except you."

I return to the poem submission, trying to focus on evaluating the work instead of processing this conversation. But Sarah's point nags at me.

What if Derek's challenges are his way of showing interest? What if his debates are how he engages with people he respects?

But even if that's true, it doesn't change the fundamental difference between Derek and Compass. One is all intellectual combat. The other is vulnerable honesty.

They're nothing alike.

That evening, I tell Madison about my conversation with Sarah.

"She thinks I'm unfairly comparing Derek to Compass."

"Are you?" Madison looks up from her homework.

"I don't know. Maybe." I flop onto my bed. "But they're so different. Derek treats everything like a game to win. Compass treats conversations like opportunities to understand."

"Does he though?" Madison sets down her pen. "Or does Compass have the luxury of careful composition while Derek has to engage in real time?"

"You sound like Sarah."

"Because we're both right." Madison turns to face me fully. "Emma, I love that you have this deep connection with Compass. I think it's beautiful. But you're using it as a shield against any real-life connection that might be complicated or messy."

"That's not true—"

"Isn't it? Derek challenges you and you find it frustrating instead of engaging. He makes good points and you're surprised instead of expecting his intelligence. He's nice to you and you're confused instead of just... seeing him."

"Seeing him as what?"

"As someone who might be worth knowing. As someone who's clearly interested in you, intellectually at minimum."

"Derek isn't interested in me. He's interested in winning arguments."

Madison just looks at me with that patient expression that means she knows I'm wrong but isn't going to push.

I roll over, staring at the ceiling. "Compass and I have something real. Something based on who we actually are, not performances or games."

"I'm not saying you don't. I'm saying maybe Derek is also showing you who he actually is—someone who engages deeply with ideas, who finds you intellectually compelling, who doesn't let you get away with easy interpretations."

"That's not the same as vulnerability."

"No, it's not. But it's also not nothing."

After Madison falls asleep, I think about the two conversations in my life that matter most. The letters with Compass—thoughtful, vulnerable, carefully composed. The debates with Derek—spontaneous, challenging, intellectually electric.

They're completely different. Different contexts, different dynamics, different ways of connecting.

But both of them, if I'm being honest, make me feel something.

Compass makes me feel understood. Seen. Known in ways I've never been known before.

Derek makes me feel... sharp. Alive. Like my mind is firing on all cylinders, like I'm capable of more than I knew.

They're nothing alike.

And I'm falling for Compass while being increasingly confused by Derek.

Which is fine. Perfectly fine. Completely uncomplicated.

I roll over and try to sleep, but my mind keeps returning to this morning's class. To Derek's grin. To the warmth in his eyes.

To the fact that for just a moment, I forgot to be frustrated and was simply... enjoying him.
