# Chapter 3: A Letter of Her Own

The blank page in my journal mocks me.

I've been sitting at my desk for twenty minutes, pen hovering, trying to find the right words. The irony isn't lost on me—I'm the editor of a literary magazine, and I can't figure out how to start a simple anonymous letter.

Madison is out at study group, which gives me privacy. But privacy doesn't help if I can't get past the fear.

*Dear whoever reads this,* I write, then immediately cross it out. Too casual.

*I'm writing because I don't know who else to tell—* Delete. Too desperate.

*Sometimes I wonder if choosing what you love over what's practical makes you brave or just stupid.*

I stare at that sentence. It's honest, at least. Maybe too honest. I flip to a new page and try again.

*I want to be a writer. That probably sounds naive, or impractical, or like something everyone says when they're seventeen and don't understand how the real world works. My parents certainly think so. They don't say it directly—they're too kind for that—but I can see it in their faces when I talk about creative writing programs. The worry. The disappointment that I'm not choosing something safe, something that guarantees security.*

My pen moves faster now, the words flowing.

*They sacrificed a lot to send me to Windermere. My dad's an accountant, my mom's a nurse, and neither of them had opportunities like this. They see education as a path to stability, to not worrying about money the way they do. And I love them for that. But how do I tell them that all the practical majors they suggest—business, education, nursing—feel like giving up on the only thing that makes me feel alive?*

*Is it selfish to want to write stories when I could choose something that actually helps people? Is it childish to believe that words matter, that creating something meaningful is worth the risk of failure?*

*I'm afraid they're right. I'm afraid I'm not talented enough, that I'll regret not choosing security. But I'm also afraid that if I don't try, I'll spend my whole life wondering what I might have been.*

*How do you choose between who you are and who you're supposed to be?*

I read it over three times. It's raw, more vulnerable than anything I've shown anyone. My stomach twists at the thought of submitting it. But that's the whole point—safety in invisibility.

I copy the letter carefully onto clean paper, my handwriting neat enough to be legible but not distinctive enough to identify. At the bottom, I sign it with the pseudonym I've been considering: *Navigator*.

Someone finding their way. That's what I need to be.

Before I can second-guess myself, I fold the letter, slip it into my bag, and head out of the dorm.

The academic building is mostly empty this late in the evening. My footsteps echo in the hallway as I climb to the third floor. The drop box is mounted on the wall outside the magazine office—a simple wooden box with a slot on top, painted Windermere's blue and gold.

I pull out my letter. Last chance to change my mind.

Instead, I slide it through the slot and hear the soft sound of paper landing inside.

Done.

I exhale slowly. Whatever happens now is out of my control. Someone will read it. Someone might respond. Or it might sit there, published but unanswered, my vulnerability on display with nothing to show for it.

Tomorrow, I tell myself. I'll worry about it tomorrow.

Mr. Harrison's English seminar is my favorite class at Windermere.

The room itself is different from typical classrooms—instead of rows of desks, we sit around a large wooden table that makes discussion feel more intimate, more like we're actually engaging with ideas instead of just receiving them. Mr. Harrison sits at the head, moderating rather than lecturing, and the best classes are the ones where he barely has to speak because we're too busy debating each other.

Today we're discussing Romantic poetry. Specifically, Wordsworth's "Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey."

"The poem is about return," Mr. Harrison says, opening the discussion. "Wordsworth revisits a place from his past and reflects on how he's changed. What do we make of his relationship with nature and memory here?"

I've read the poem three times in preparation. Wordsworth writes about nature as a kind of salvation, a force that sustains him in the chaos of urban life. There's something deeply emotional about it, the way he trusts that natural beauty will continue to provide comfort.

"It's about finding constancy in a changing world," I offer. "Wordsworth returns to this place and realizes that even though he's different—older, maybe more cynical—nature still offers him the same peace it did before. It's emotional anchoring."

Several students nod. Mr. Harrison looks pleased.

"Interesting. Anyone want to build on that or offer a different reading?"

"I'd argue it's less about emotion and more about philosophy."

The voice comes from across the table. Derek Lane.

I glance up to find him already looking at me, his expression challenging in that way that immediately sets my teeth on edge. Derek is the kind of student who loves playing devil's advocate, who never just agrees with an interpretation even when it's perfectly reasonable. He argues for sport.

"Go on," Mr. Harrison encourages.

Derek leans back in his chair. "Wordsworth isn't just feeling his way through the poem. He's making an intellectual argument about consciousness and perception. The whole piece is structured around the idea that we can train ourselves to use memories of beauty to counteract present suffering. That's cognitive work, not emotional surrender."

"He's still feeling it," I counter before I can stop myself. "The philosophy is there, sure, but it's grounded in genuine emotional experience. You can't separate the intellectual framework from the feeling that drives it."

"Can't you?" Derek's eyebrow raises slightly. "The poem literally describes how he's learned to use these memories analytically—'In hours of weariness, sensations sweet.' That's deliberate recall, not spontaneous emotion."

"It's both," I insist, my voice sharper than I intended. "That's what makes it powerful. He's not just coldly analyzing his relationship with nature. He's describing how beauty becomes part of your internal landscape, how it sustains you. That's emotional, even if he's being thoughtful about it."

"But by your reading, any intellectual examination of emotion becomes inherently emotional, which collapses the distinction entirely."

I feel my face flush. "That's not what I'm saying—"

"Isn't it? You're prioritizing the emotional content over the structural argument Wordsworth is actually making about perception and memory."

"Because the emotional content is what gives the argument meaning!" I lean forward. "Strip away the feeling and you're left with an academic exercise. Wordsworth cares about this place. That care is the point."

"The care is the subject matter. The point is the philosophical framework he builds around it."

"Excellent exchange," Mr. Harrison interjects, clearly enjoying this. "What do others think? Is the poem primarily an emotional expression or a philosophical argument?"

The discussion opens up, other students offering perspectives. But I barely hear them because I'm still mentally sparring with Derek, running through counterarguments, frustrated that he won't just concede the obvious emotional depth of the poem.

I glance across the table and find Derek watching me with an expression I can't quite read. When our eyes meet, something flickers across his face—amusement, maybe? Or satisfaction?

It makes me even more irritated.

Charlotte Reynolds jumps in supporting Derek's interpretation, and I force myself to focus on the broader discussion instead of fixating on my frustration. Other students offer nuanced readings that acknowledge both emotion and intellect, which makes me feel slightly validated but also annoyed that Derek pushed me into such a polarized position.

By the time class ends, I'm wound tight with residual argumentative energy.

"Good discussion today," Mr. Harrison says as we pack up. "Emma, Derek—nice work pushing each other. That's exactly the kind of rigorous engagement I like to see."

Derek nods, slinging his bag over his shoulder. As he passes my seat, he says, "Fair points about the emotional landscape, Sullivan. I still think you're underweighting the philosophical structure, but you argued it well."

Is that supposed to be a compliment? I can't tell if he's being genuine or patronizing.

"You too," I manage, which feels inadequate but is all I can come up with.

He leaves, and I'm left gathering my books while Charlotte lingers near Mr. Harrison's desk, laughing at something he said.

Sarah appears at my elbow. "That was intense."

"He argues about everything," I mutter. "Even when the interpretation is completely reasonable, he has to challenge it."

"Maybe he just likes debating with you specifically."

I give her a look. "Or maybe he likes being contrary for its own sake."

Sarah grins. "Whatever you say. But you have to admit, it makes class more interesting when you two go at it."

"I'd prefer less interesting and more agreement that Wordsworth is writing from emotional experience."

"Of course you would. You're a writer." Sarah pats my shoulder. "Come on. We have magazine stuff to go through before dinner."

I follow her out, still mentally replaying the argument. The thing about Derek Lane is that he's smart enough to make actually compelling points, which makes it impossible to simply dismiss him. But he wields that intelligence like a weapon, challenging everything anyone says as if agreement would be some kind of defeat.

It's exhausting.

And the worst part is that hours later, walking to dinner, I'm still thinking about his counterarguments. Still wishing I'd phrased my points differently, made a stronger case for the emotional weight of the poem.

"You're doing the thing," Madison observes as we enter the dining hall.

"What thing?"

"The thing where you mentally continue an argument long after it's over. Who was it this time?"

"Derek Lane. English class."

"Ah." Madison's expression turns knowing. "Your favorite person."

"He's not my anything. He's just—difficult."

"Uh-huh."

I don't dignify that with a response.

That night, lying in bed, I think about the letter I submitted. About vulnerability and anonymity and the hope that someone out there might understand the impossible tension between passion and practicality.

I wonder what Derek Lane would say about it.

Then I immediately banish the thought because Derek Lane is the last person who would understand. He treats everything like an intellectual game, not something to actually feel.

Somewhere in this school, someone submitted a letter that might match mine. Someone who might actually get it.

I just have to wait and see if anyone responds.
