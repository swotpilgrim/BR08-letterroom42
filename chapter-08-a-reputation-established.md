# Chapter 8: A Reputation Established

I first realize we have a reputation when I overhear two juniors talking in the library.

"—bet they'll argue about it in class tomorrow—"

"Obviously. Sullivan and Lane always go at it about whatever we're reading."

"Think they secretly like each other?"

"Nah, they genuinely seem to disagree about everything."

I'm shelving books two aisles over, and they clearly don't realize I can hear them. My face heats. I finish shelving quickly and escape to the magazine office before they can notice me.

But once I'm aware of it, I can't stop noticing. The knowing looks when Derek and I start debating in English. The way Mr. Harrison smiles slightly whenever one of us challenges the other's interpretation. The fact that students seem to anticipate our disagreements, waiting to see what we'll argue about next.

"Does it bother you?" Sarah asks me Thursday afternoon.

We're in the magazine office, working through submissions for the next issue. I look up from the poem I'm reading.

"Does what bother me?"

"That people talk about you and Derek. The debates." She gestures vaguely. "Someone called it 'the Sullivan-Lane show' at lunch yesterday."

I set down the poem. "People are talking about our class discussions?"

"I mean, yeah." Sarah looks apologetic. "You two have the most intense arguments in seminar. It's kind of entertaining to watch."

"It's not entertainment." I hear the defensive edge in my voice. "We're engaging with the material. That's what we're supposed to do in a discussion-based class."

"I know. I didn't mean it like that." Sarah leans against the desk. "I just meant—does it bother you that it's become this thing people notice?"

I consider that. Part of me wants to say yes, it bothers me, because I don't like being observed or reduced to a pattern people can predict. But another part of me—a part I don't want to examine too closely—feels oddly satisfied that our discussions are substantial enough to be memorable.

"Derek just frustrates me," I say finally. "He challenges everything I say, even when my interpretation is perfectly valid."

"But you challenge him back."

"Because he's wrong about half the stuff he argues."

"Is he?" Sarah's smile is gentle. "Or are you both right about different aspects of complex texts?"

I don't have a good answer to that, so I return to reading submissions.

The conversation I'm not having with Sarah continues in my head over the next few days. Every time Derek and I debate something in class, I'm newly aware of our audience. Of the fact that this has become expected, predictable, something people watch for.

It shouldn't bother me. Class discussion is literally designed to be public intellectual exchange. But there's something unsettling about realizing my dynamic with Derek has been categorized, labeled, turned into a recognizable pattern.

"You know he only argues with you that intensely, right?" Madison mentions Friday evening.

We're in our dorm room. I'm editing an article for the magazine while she studies for a history exam.

"What?"

"Derek. He debates in class with other people, but not like he does with you. You're the only one he really goes after."

"Lucky me."

"I'm serious, Emma." Madison sets down her textbook. "Remember last week when Rachel made a point about *Jane Eyre* and Derek just nodded and built on it? He didn't challenge her or push back or play devil's advocate. He just agreed and moved on."

I think back to that class. Madison's right—Rachel said something about Jane's independence being radical for the period, and Derek simply acknowledged it and added a point about Rochester's character development.

"Maybe he agreed with her interpretation."

"Or maybe he doesn't find her interesting enough to debate with." Madison gives me a significant look. "He saves the real arguments for you."

"Because I actually push back. I don't just fold when he challenges me."

"Exactly." Madison's expression suggests I'm missing something obvious. "He respects that you push back. Maybe that's why he keeps engaging."

"Or maybe he just likes being contrary."

Madison shrugs, returning to her history notes. But her theory lingers in my mind.

Does Derek specifically seek out arguments with me? Is there something deliberate about the way he challenges my interpretations, the way he never just lets a point go unchallenged?

And if so—why?

Saturday afternoon, I'm in the magazine office when Mrs. Whitmore stops by to drop off a book she thought I'd enjoy.

"How's senior year treating you?" she asks, settling into the chair across from my desk.

"Busy. Good." I accept the book—*The Bloody Chamber* by Angela Carter. "Thank you for this."

"I thought you'd appreciate her reimagining of fairy tales." Mrs. Whitmore adjusts her reading glasses. "How are your classes?"

"Fine. English is..." I pause, trying to find the right word. "Intense."

"Mr. Harrison's seminars usually are." She smiles. "You and Derek Lane have been having some spirited discussions, I hear."

My stomach drops slightly. Even Mrs. Whitmore has heard about our debates.

"He's frustrating," I say carefully. "He challenges everything, even when the interpretation is sound."

"Ah." Mrs. Whitmore leans back, expression thoughtful. "I taught Derek in sophomore English. Brilliant student. Loves playing with ideas."

"Playing is the right word."

"Is it?" She tilts her head. "Or is he genuinely engaging with complexity?"

I don't answer immediately. Mrs. Whitmore has a way of asking questions that require real thought rather than reflexive responses.

"I guess both," I admit. "He's smart. But he also seems to argue for its own sake."

"Some people think most clearly through debate." Mrs. Whitmore pauses. "Emma, can I offer you some unsolicited wisdom?"

"Always."

"The people who challenge us most are often the ones who help us grow most. It's easy to surround yourself with people who agree, who validate your perspectives. Much harder to engage with someone who pushes back, who makes you defend your ideas and examine your assumptions."

I think about that. About how Derek's challenges have forced me to articulate my interpretations more precisely, to find textual evidence I might have overlooked, to consider angles I hadn't thought about.

"That doesn't make it less annoying," I say finally.

Mrs. Whitmore laughs. "No, it certainly doesn't. But sometimes the most valuable intellectual relationships are the most challenging. The person who pushes hardest might be showing the most respect for your mind."

After she leaves, I sit with that idea. The notion that Derek's constant challenges are actually a form of respect feels counterintuitive. Surely respect would look like agreement, or at least less combative engagement.

But maybe Mrs. Whitmore has a point. Maybe Derek debates with me specifically because he thinks I can handle it, because he trusts that I'll push back effectively, because he finds our exchanges worthwhile enough to keep having them.

Or maybe I'm overcomplicating what is simply Derek enjoying argument for its own sake.

I don't know. And the not knowing is its own kind of frustration.

That evening, I draft a letter to Compass.

I don't mention Derek by name, don't identify the specific situation. But I write about the experience of having a classmate who challenges everything I say, who seems to disagree on principle, who treats every discussion like a debate to win rather than a conversation to have.

*It's exhausting,* I write. *And confusing, because sometimes in the middle of an argument I realize they're making me think more clearly. They push me to defend my positions better, to find evidence I might have missed, to consider angles I hadn't explored. But that doesn't change the fact that constant challenge feels combative rather than collaborative.*

*Is it possible to respect someone intellectually while also finding them incredibly irritating to interact with? Or am I just making excuses for why their antagonism bothers me so much?*

I seal the letter and drop it in the submission box before I can second-guess the vulnerability.

Compass will understand. Compass always understands.

Sunday morning, the new issue of the magazine comes out. I collect my copy from the mailroom with the familiar mix of anticipation and nervousness—anticipation for Compass's response, nervousness about what I've shared.

His letter is waiting in the exchange section.

*Navigator,*

*Your question resonated with me because I've been thinking about something similar lately. I have someone in my life—a classmate—who I constantly disagree with. We argue about books, about interpretation, about meaning. It's intense and sometimes frustrating and I'm never quite sure if we're having a intellectual exchange or just being contrary for sport.*

*But here's what I've realized: I think more clearly when I'm arguing with her. She challenges my assumptions in ways that make me examine why I believe what I believe. She doesn't let me get away with lazy thinking. And even when she's frustrating, even when we're on completely opposite sides of an interpretation, I respect the hell out of her mind.*

*So to answer your question: yes, absolutely possible to respect someone intellectually while finding them irritating. In fact, I think maybe the people who irritate us most are the ones who challenge us to grow, and growth is always uncomfortable.*

*That doesn't mean constant challenge is fun. But it might mean it's valuable.*

*Does that help? Or am I just rationalizing why I keep seeking out arguments with someone who drives me slightly crazy?*

*—Compass*

I read the letter three times.

Compass has a classmate he argues with too. Someone who challenges him, frustrates him, makes him think more clearly. A female classmate, based on his pronouns.

The parallel is striking. Both of us navigating relationships with people who engage through debate rather than easy agreement. Both of us unsure whether the constant challenge is valuable or just exhausting.

And Compass's answer—that discomfort might signal growth—feels true in a way I wasn't ready to acknowledge.

I carry the magazine back to my dorm, thinking about Mrs. Whitmore's wisdom and Compass's insight and the possibility that Derek's challenges are a kind of respect I haven't learned to recognize yet.

I still find him irritating.

But maybe that's not the whole story.
