# Chapter 19: Hurt and Anger

By Monday, the hurt had calcified into something harder. Anger, maybe. Or something close to it.

I'd spent the weekend rereading Compass's letters, trying to reconcile the vulnerable writer with the argumentative debater, and the more I thought about it, the more questions crowded my mind. Questions that didn't have comfortable answers.

If Derek had been Compass all along, that meant he'd been writing those intimate, understanding letters while simultaneously challenging every idea I presented in English class. He'd been telling me—as Compass—that he understood my creative ambitions and fears, while making me defend my literary interpretations in front of our classmates.

Had he been laughing at me the whole time?

The thought made my stomach twist. What if the correspondence had been some elaborate game to him? What if he'd figured out I was Navigator weeks ago and kept writing, kept challenging me publicly, just to see how long it would take me to notice?

I knew I was being paranoid. The shock on Derek's face when he'd realized I was Navigator had seemed completely genuine. But hurt makes you doubt everything, even evidence you've seen with your own eyes.

Monday afternoon, I was in the magazine office sorting through submissions for the next issue when Sarah Bennett knocked on the open door.

"Hey, Emma." She stepped inside, her arms full of poetry submissions. "Got some new pieces for you to review."

"Thanks." I took the papers from her, added them to the already substantial pile on my desk. "How's your workshop piece coming?"

"Good, I think. Mrs. Whitmore suggested some revisions." Sarah hesitated, hovering near the desk in a way that meant she wanted to say something but wasn't sure how. "Are you okay? You've seemed kind of... off... lately."

I forced a smile. "I'm fine. Just busy with the magazine and keeping up with classes."

"It's just—" Sarah bit her lip. "The anonymous letter exchange has been really popular. People keep asking when the next issue is coming out because they want to see the new letters. Especially from Compass and Navigator. Everyone's really invested in their correspondence."

My hands stilled on the papers I'd been organizing. "Right."

"Is everything okay with that feature? I know you run it, so if there's some issue—"

"Everything's fine," I said quickly. Too quickly. "Some correspondences just run their course. People stop writing."

Sarah nodded, but she looked uncertain. "Okay. Well, let me know if you need any help with the next issue."

After she left, I sat alone in the office and stared at the stacks of submissions. The letter exchange feature had been my idea, my baby. I'd pitched it to Mrs. Whitmore as a way to let students express themselves honestly without the vulnerability of public authorship.

And it had worked. Too well, maybe.

Because I'd fallen for someone's words without knowing who they were, and now I didn't know if anything about it had been real.

English class that afternoon was torture.

Derek came in just before the bell, took his usual seat across the seminar circle from me. Our eyes met for a brief second—his expression unreadable, carefully controlled—before we both looked away.

Mr. Harrison dove into discussion of the Virginia Woolf essay we'd been assigned, asking his usual probing questions designed to spark debate. Normally, Derek and I would both jump in with interpretations, building on or challenging each other's points.

Today, we sat in silence.

"Emma," Mr. Harrison said, looking directly at me. "You usually have thoughts on Woolf's concept of androgyny in writing. What's your take on this passage?"

I could feel Derek's gaze on me, though I refused to look at him. "I think Woolf is arguing for a kind of psychological balance in the creative mind. Male and female elements coexisting."

"Interesting. Derek, you want to build on that or offer a counterpoint?"

Derek was quiet for a moment. Then: "I think Emma's interpretation is valid."

The room went still. Mr. Harrison's eyebrows rose. Derek Lane had just agreed with my interpretation without debate, without challenge, without even a follow-up question.

It was completely unprecedented.

"Really?" Mr. Harrison sounded as surprised as I felt. "No thoughts on the historical context of Woolf's argument? The feminist implications?"

"I'm sure Emma's considered those angles," Derek said evenly.

I finally looked at him. His expression was carefully neutral, but there was something in his eyes—hurt, maybe, or resignation. He was refusing to engage with me entirely, withdrawing the very thing that had characterized our dynamic for months.

And somehow that felt worse than the arguments ever had.

Charlotte Reynolds, sensing the void, jumped in with her own interpretation. Derek nodded along, asked her a few clarifying questions, engaged with her ideas in a way that felt like a deliberate contrast to his silence with me.

Charlotte brightened under his attention, leaning forward as she elaborated on her points. They went back and forth for several minutes—Derek offering counterpoints, Charlotte defending her reading, both clearly enjoying the intellectual sparring. A proper debate, exactly like the ones Derek and I used to have.

I sat across the circle feeling like I was watching something that should have been mine.

The irrational thought made me angry at myself. I didn't want to debate Derek. I was furious with him.

Wasn't I?

By the end of class, my hands were clenched so tight my nails had left marks in my palms.

I caught Derek in the hallway outside the classroom, before he could disappear with Andrew the way he'd been doing all week.

"Can we talk?" I asked. My voice came out sharper than I intended.

Derek stopped, turned to face me. Andrew, reading the room, muttered something about forgetting a book and vanished back toward the classroom.

We stood in the hallway, students flowing around us on their way to other classes. Derek waited, watching me with that same careful neutrality.

"Was it a game?" The question burst out before I could phrase it more diplomatically. "The letters. The correspondence. Was it some kind of joke to you?"

Derek's expression flickered—surprise, then hurt, then something that might have been anger. "What?"

"You were writing these vulnerable letters to me while arguing with me in every class." The words tumbled out, all the doubts and questions I'd been nursing all weekend. "Were you laughing at me the whole time? Seeing how long it would take me to figure it out?"

"Are you serious right now?" Derek's voice had gone low, dangerous in a way I'd never heard before. "You think I was playing some kind of game?"

"I don't know what to think!" My voice rose, and I saw a few passing students glance our way. I lowered it again, but the intensity remained. "You're two completely different people, Derek. In letters you're vulnerable and understanding. In person you tear apart my ideas—"

"I engage with your ideas," Derek interrupted, and now there was definite anger in his tone. "There's a difference."

"Is there? Because from where I'm standing—"

"It was the most real thing in my life at Windermere." Derek's words cut through mine, quiet but fierce. "Writing to Navigator. Being honest about who I am and what I want without all the—" He gestured around the hallway, at Windermere, at everything. "Without the performance. Without having to be the scholarship kid who has it all figured out. It was real, Emma. The only completely real thing."

The raw honesty in his voice caught me off guard. But I was too angry, too hurt, to let it land fully.

"If it was so real, why did you hide behind anonymity?"

Derek stared at me. "I could ask you the exact same question."

That stopped me. Because he was right. I'd hidden behind Navigator just as much as he'd hidden behind Compass. I'd poured my real self into those letters while maintaining careful boundaries in person.

"That's different," I said, but it sounded weak even to me.

"How?"

"Because I—" I started, then stopped. Because I didn't have a good answer. "I just needed to know if it was real. The connection. If you meant what you wrote."

"Every word." Derek's jaw was tight, hands shoved in his pockets. "I meant every single word. But clearly Navigator isn't who I thought she was."

The words stung. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means you're so convinced I'm two different people that you can't see I'm the same person in both contexts. Just showing different sides." Derek shook his head. "I thought Navigator understood that people are complicated. That we contain multitudes. But I guess that understanding only extended as far as the page."

"That's not fair—"

"Isn't it?" Derek's voice was quiet now, tired. "You fell for Compass because he was vulnerable in a way that felt safe. Anonymous. But the second you found out Compass was me—someone who challenges you, someone who isn't just safe and comfortable—you decided it couldn't be real."

I opened my mouth to argue, but Derek was already walking away.

"Derek—"

He didn't turn around.

I stood in the emptying hallway, my heart pounding, anger and hurt and confusion all tangled together in a knot I couldn't unravel.

Around me, students headed to their next classes, to study halls, to afternoon activities. Normal Windermere life continuing while mine felt like it was fracturing into increasingly smaller pieces.

I'd wanted to confront Derek, to get answers, to understand what had happened between Compass and Navigator.

All I'd done was make it worse.

And the worst part—the absolute worst part—was that Derek was right. I'd loved Navigator's understanding of complexity in the abstract. But the second I'd had to apply that understanding to Derek as a real, complicated person showing different sides in different contexts, I'd balked.

I'd wanted Compass to be simple. Safe. Someone I could fall for without risk.

But Derek was neither simple nor safe.

And I had no idea what to do with that truth.
