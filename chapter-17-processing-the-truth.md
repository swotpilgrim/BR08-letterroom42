# Chapter 17: Processing the Truth

I don't know how long I sat there, staring at the letter in my hands. Could have been seconds. Could have been minutes. The words I'd read four times blurred together, meaningless now that I knew who'd written them.

Derek Lane.

The sound of the door opening again made me jump. I looked up, half-expecting to see him there, but it was just the evening janitor, Mr. Patterson, wheeling his cart past. He nodded at me through the doorway and continued down the hall.

My hands were shaking. I set the letter down on the desk, smoothed it flat with trembling fingers.

I needed to think. Needed to process this. But my brain kept circling the same impossible fact: Derek and Compass were the same person.

The door opened a third time.

This time it was Derek.

He stood in the doorway again, looking less certain than I'd ever seen him. His hands were shoved in his pockets, shoulders tense. "Can I—can we talk about this?"

Part of me wanted to say no, to send him away so I could figure out what I was feeling before I had to face him. But another part—the part that had been corresponding with Compass for three months—needed answers.

"How long have you known?" The words came out sharper than I intended. "That I was Navigator?"

"I didn't." Derek stepped into the office, let the door swing shut behind him. "Not until right now. I swear, Emma. I never tried to figure out who you were."

I wanted to believe him. The shocked recognition on his face when he'd seen me holding his letter had seemed genuine. But trust felt dangerous right now.

"Why not?" I asked. "If you were writing to someone, sharing all that—" I gestured at the letter on my desk. "Why wouldn't you want to know?"

Derek's jaw tightened. "Because I wanted to keep that separate. Anonymous letters were supposed to be this space where I could just... be honest without all the other stuff getting in the way."

"What other stuff?"

"Expectations. Competition. The whole—" He waved a hand, encompassing Windermere, the pressure, everything we lived in. "I thought if I knew who Navigator was, it would change things. Make it harder to be that honest."

I understood that. Hated that I understood it, but I did. Wasn't that exactly why I'd never tried to figure out Compass's identity? The anonymity had felt safe.

But it hadn't been safe at all, had it?

"I don't understand how you can be Compass," I said, and the words came out sounding almost accusatory. "The person who writes those letters—who talks about vulnerability and understanding and creative dreams—that's not you."

Something flickered across Derek's face. Hurt, maybe. "How can you say that? You don't know me."

"I know you argue with me about everything in English class. I know you challenge every interpretation I offer like you're trying to prove me wrong. Every single time I present an idea, you're right there ready to pick it apart."

"That's not what I'm doing—" Derek broke off, ran a hand through his hair in frustration. The gesture was agitated, uncharacteristically uncontrolled. "God, Emma, how can you be Navigator? You're so certain of your opinions in class, so ready to defend your ideas without hesitation. But in the letters you're vulnerable and questioning and willing to admit uncertainty. You write about being afraid you're not good enough, about doubting your own talent. Where is that person when we're in English class?"

"Real?" I supplied, the word bitter. "Is that what you were going to say? That Navigator is real and this—" I gestured at myself sitting at the editor's desk. "This version isn't?"

"I was going to say *honest*," Derek shot back. "In your letters you admit when you're not sure about something. You let yourself be uncertain."

We were both standing now, though I didn't remember getting to my feet. The desk created a physical barrier between us, stacks of submissions and back issues like a wall.

"I thought Compass was someone who understood me," I said, and my voice cracked on the words. "Someone who saw who I really was."

"I do understand you." Derek's voice rose to match mine. "I do see you, Emma."

"In letters!"

"Letters are real!" Derek stepped closer to the desk, hands clenched at his sides. "Everything I wrote to you was true. Every single word. That's the most real I've been with anyone at Windermere."

"Then why?" The question burst out of me, raw and confused. "Why do you argue with me in person if you understand me so well in writing? Why do you challenge every idea I have like you're trying to tear it apart?"

Derek stared at me across the desk, and I watched emotions chase across his face—frustration, confusion, something that might have been desperation.

"Because challenging someone isn't dismissing them," he said finally. His voice had dropped, intense but quieter. "When I debate your interpretations in class, it's because I take your ideas seriously. Seriously enough to engage with them completely, to test them, to see if they hold up under examination."

"That's not what it feels like."

"What does it feel like?"

I swallowed hard. "Like you think I'm wrong. Like you're trying to prove I'm wrong."

"I'm trying to understand how you think." Derek's knuckles were white where his hands gripped the edge of the desk. "You have the most interesting mind of anyone in that class. In this whole school, probably. When you present an interpretation, I want to see every angle of it. I want to know why you think that way, what led you there, whether you've considered the counterargument."

"That's—" I shook my head. "That's not how it comes across."

"I know." He said it quietly. "I'm realizing that now."

The office felt too small again. I was acutely aware of how close we were, just the width of the desk between us. Close enough that I could see the genuine distress in his eyes, the tension in his shoulders.

"I don't know what to do with this," I admitted. The fight drained out of me, leaving just confusion and exhaustion. "I spent three months falling for Compass's words. For the person I thought he was. And now I find out he's you, and I don't—I can't—"

"Can't what?"

"Reconcile it," I finished. "You're not the same person."

Derek flinched like I'd hit him. "Yes, I am. Emma, I'm exactly the same person. The guy who writes those letters and the guy who debates with you in English class—that's both me. Both real."

"But they don't fit together." I heard the plea in my own voice. "Compass is vulnerable and understanding. You're all sarcasm and intellectual challenge."

"Maybe I show vulnerability in writing because it feels safer," Derek said. "And maybe I use debate in person as a way to connect with people whose minds I respect. Did you ever think of that?"

I hadn't. But I couldn't admit that right now, couldn't give any ground when my entire understanding of my world had just shattered.

"I need you to leave." The words came out steadier than I felt. "I need time to think about this."

Derek's face fell. "Emma—"

"Please." I couldn't look at him anymore. Stared down at Compass's letter instead, at the handwriting that belonged to Derek Lane. "Just go."

For a long moment, he didn't move. Then I heard him draw in a breath, let it out slowly.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Yeah. Okay."

His footsteps crossed to the door. I heard it open, heard him pause in the doorway.

"For what it's worth," Derek said, and his voice sounded rough, "Navigator's letters have been the best part of my time at Windermere. Getting to know you through those words—the real you, the honest you—that's been everything to me. I'm sorry that doesn't translate to who you think I am in person."

Then he was gone.

The door clicked shut with a soft finality.

I sank back into the editor's chair, legs suddenly unable to hold me. My hands found Compass's letter again, smoothed over the words I'd treasured.

*You don't ask me to choose between them. You just see me.*

But I didn't see him, did I? I'd seen Compass in these letters and Derek in English class, and never understood they were the same person. Never tried to look deeper than the surface he presented.

And now he thought I wished he were someone else.

Maybe I did.

I didn't know anymore.

The magazine office felt cavernous and empty. Outside the window, I could see students crossing the quad in pairs and small groups, heading back to dorms before curfew. Normal campus life continuing while mine had just fractured into pieces I couldn't fit back together.

I folded Compass's letter carefully along its creases and slipped it into my bag. Then I gathered the rest of the submissions, organized them into their proper piles, turned off the desk lamp. My hands moved through the familiar motions automatically, muscle memory from months of closing up the office after late work sessions.

Everything looked exactly as it had an hour ago. The same stacks of papers, the same old typewriter, the same view out the window to the quad.

Everything was completely different.

An hour ago, I'd been a girl who knew exactly what she felt—falling for Compass's words while maintaining a careful antagonism with Derek Lane. The world had made sense. My feelings had made sense.

Now nothing made sense at all.

As I locked the magazine office door and headed down the empty hallway, I tried to remember what Derek's face had looked like when I'd told him I couldn't reconcile who he was. Tried to recall the exact note in his voice when he'd said Navigator's letters had been everything to him.

But all I could think about was the hurt in his eyes when I'd asked him to leave.

And the fact that I'd just broken something I hadn't even known was whole.
