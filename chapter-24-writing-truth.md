# Chapter 24: Writing Truth

The blank page mocked me.

I'd been sitting in the magazine office for an hour, pen in hand, trying to find the right words. I had my journal full of raw material—pages of processing and confusion and gradual understanding. I had a deadline—the reading was in ten days. I had the will to be honest.

What I didn't have was the courage to actually put that honesty on paper in a form I'd share with the entire school.

I wrote another opening line. Crossed it out. Tried again.

*Falling for someone is easy when you control how you see them.*

True, but too bitter. I wasn't trying to be bitter.

*We contain multitudes, the poet said. But what happens when you fall for one version of someone and discover they're more complicated than that?*

Closer. But still not right.

I set down my pen and stared out the window. Across campus, students moved between buildings in their afternoon routines. Somewhere out there, Derek was probably in class or the library or Room 42, unaware that I was trying to find words to explain what I'd learned from him.

About him. Because of him.

I picked up my pen again.

*The person who challenges you might be the same person who understands you. The vulnerability someone shows in writing might come from the same place as the confidence they show in debate. And accepting that both are real—that people are complicated and multifaceted and can't be reduced to single dimensions—requires a courage I'm only now learning to find.*

I stared at those words. They felt true. Honest. Terrifying.

I kept writing.

The piece came together slowly over the next week.

I wrote in the magazine office during free periods, surrounded by submissions and back issues and the familiar smell of old paper and ink. I wrote in the library late at night, tucked into a corner carrel where no one would disturb me. I wrote in my dorm room with Madison pretending to study but actually watching me work with quiet encouragement.

The essay wasn't about Derek specifically—I was careful about that. No names, no identifying details about the letter exchange. But it was about everything I'd learned from the situation.

About discovering someone through words and falling for their vulnerability and honesty. About the shock of learning that person was someone you thought you knew in a completely different context. About the temptation to insist they must be two separate people because integrating them feels too complicated, too risky.

About realizing that insisting on separation is really just fear dressed up as logic.

I wrote about argument as a form of intimacy. About how challenging someone's ideas can be a sign of respect, of taking their mind seriously enough to engage fully. About learning to recognize different love languages—some people show care through gentle support, others through rigorous challenge.

I wrote about safety versus reality. About how anonymous connection feels less dangerous because you control how much of yourself you show, because you can walk away, because the other person remains comfortably abstract.

About having to choose whether you want safe or real, because you can't have both.

I wrote about my own fear—not naming it as mine, but making it universal enough that anyone listening might recognize their own resistance to complexity in relationships. The fear of being truly known. The fear of discovering that love requires accepting difficulty alongside ease, challenge alongside comfort.

The fear that if you let yourself fall for the whole complicated person, the risk of loss becomes unbearable.

But also: the recognition that refusing that risk means settling for something less than real. Less than full. Less than the connection you actually crave.

The words poured out, revised and refined over multiple drafts. I worked on transitions, tightened the prose, made sure the piece would work read aloud—that the rhythm would carry, that the emotional beats would land even in spoken form.

"How's it going?" Madison asked one evening.

I was at my desk, surrounded by crumpled false starts. The current draft sat in front of me, marked with corrections and margin notes.

"I think I'm close," I said. "Maybe one more revision."

"Can I read it?"

I hesitated. Madison had been encouraging me to write this from the beginning, but showing her the actual piece felt vulnerable in a way I hadn't anticipated.

"It's pretty personal," I warned.

"I know." Madison's expression was kind. "But I'd like to read it, if you're willing to share."

I handed her the pages.

Madison read slowly, carefully, not interrupting. I watched her face for reactions—saw her expression shift from interest to recognition to something that looked like pride. When she reached the end, she looked up with tears in her eyes.

"Emma," she said softly. "This is beautiful. And brave."

"Really?"

"Really." She handed the pages back reverently. "It's honest in a way your previous work hasn't been. You're not hiding behind intellectualism or polish. You're just... truthful. About the struggle, about the fear, about what you've learned."

"Is it too personal? Can people tell it's about Derek?"

Madison considered. "They'll probably guess. But that's not a bad thing. You're not exposing his privacy or sharing details that aren't yours to share. You're processing your own journey, your own understanding. That's your story to tell."

I looked down at the essay. At the words I'd worked so hard to get right.

"I'm terrified to read this in front of everyone," I admitted.

"I know." Madison smiled. "But you're going to do it anyway, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

I thought about that. "Because Derek was brave first. He was vulnerable in those letters, then honest about them being real even when I reacted badly. He took the risk of being seen completely."

"And now it's your turn."

"Yes." I gathered the pages carefully. "Now it's my turn."

The final draft came together two days before the reading.

I worked on it in the magazine office, reading sections aloud to test how they sounded, making tiny adjustments to word choice and rhythm. The piece had evolved through at least a dozen revisions, but this version finally felt complete.

It was a personal essay, creative nonfiction in the tradition of the writers I loved—vulnerable and reflective, specific in detail but universal in theme. About four pages when written out neatly, which would be maybe six or seven minutes of reading aloud.

The essay opened with the question of how we know people. Moved through the discovery that someone can show you different facets in different contexts—vulnerability in writing, confidence in person, honesty in private, guardedness in public. Explored the temptation to choose one version as "real" and dismiss the others as performance.

Then the turn: realizing that all versions are real. That people contain multitudes, and knowing someone means accepting the complexity rather than demanding simplicity.

The essay ended with a reflection on courage. On the courage required to be vulnerable, yes, but also the courage required to *see* someone's vulnerability. To accept that the person who challenges you might be showing love. To risk falling for the whole complicated person rather than hiding behind the safety of partial knowledge.

On the courage to say: I see you. All of you. And I'm choosing to step into that complexity instead of running from it.

I read through it one final time, made a few tiny word changes, then copied it out neatly on fresh paper. My handwriting was careful, deliberate—I wanted to be able to read it clearly tomorrow without stumbling.

This was it.

This was what I'd say to the whole school—to Mrs. Whitmore and Sarah and Charlotte and all my classmates.

To Derek.

Because he'd be there. Sitting in the auditorium, listening to every word, understanding exactly what I was really saying beneath the universal language of the essay.

*I see you now. I see that Compass and Derek are the same person, and I'm trying to have the courage to accept both. To accept all of you.*

Whether he'd believe me after everything that had happened, I didn't know. Whether he'd still want me to see him after I'd spent weeks insisting I couldn't—that was uncertain too.

But at least he'd know I'd tried.

At least he'd know I'd found, or was finding, the courage he'd shown me first.

The night before the reading, I couldn't sleep.

I lay in bed, the essay memorized from reading it so many times but still terrifying in its honesty. Tomorrow evening I'd stand in front of the entire school and share these words. Make this declaration. Take this risk.

Madison's steady breathing came from her bed across the room. Outside, campus was quiet—just the normal night sounds of old buildings settling, wind in the trees, distant laughter from one of the dorms.

Somewhere in Bancroft Hall, Derek might be awake too. Might be thinking about the reading event, though he wouldn't know what I planned to share. Might be preparing his own piece, if he'd signed up to read.

I hadn't checked the reading list since I'd added my name. Hadn't wanted to know if Derek's name was there too. The possibility felt too loaded, too significant.

Tomorrow I'd find out.

Tomorrow I'd stand in front of everyone and be honest about the most confusing, painful, clarifying experience I'd had at Windermere.

Tomorrow Derek would hear me, and maybe—just maybe—understand what I'd been too afraid to say directly.

*I see you. I'm trying. Please don't give up on me yet.*

I pulled my blanket tighter and watched the shadows on the ceiling shift as clouds moved across the moon outside.

Tomorrow.

Everything might change tomorrow.

The thought terrified me.

The thought gave me hope.

Both were true at the same time, and I was finally learning to accept that contradictions could coexist.

Just like Derek—vulnerable and confident, Compass and debater, complicated and real and exactly himself in all his multifaceted glory.

I just hoped I wasn't too late to tell him I understood.
