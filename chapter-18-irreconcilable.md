# Chapter 18: Irreconcilable

The next few days were excruciating.

I'd thought avoiding Derek would be simple enough—Windermere was small, but not that small. Different routes to class, strategic timing, basic evasion. Except Derek had apparently had the same idea, which meant we were both actively trying not to see each other, creating this awkward dance of avoidance that somehow made me more aware of him than ever.

On Wednesday, he didn't show up to English class.

I noticed his empty seat immediately—impossible not to, since Mr. Harrison had arranged the seminar room in a circle and Derek's usual spot was directly across from mine. The chair sat vacant the entire period, a glaring absence that everyone noticed but no one mentioned.

Mr. Harrison tried to spark the usual discussion, but without Derek there to challenge interpretations and push back on readings, the conversation fell flat. I offered my analysis of the Frost poem we'd been assigned, and instead of Derek jumping in with a counterargument about structure or metaphorical consistency, Charlotte Reynolds nodded politely and Sarah Bennett agreed with me.

It felt wrong. Empty.

I hated that I missed the debate.

Thursday, I saw Derek crossing the quad as I was heading to the library. He was walking with Andrew, their heads bent in serious conversation. I stopped in my tracks, then immediately veered left toward the longer route that would take me around Bancroft Hall instead of between the dorms.

My heart was pounding like I'd been running.

Friday morning, we almost collided outside the dining hall. I was leaving breakfast early, not particularly hungry, and he was coming up the stone steps as I was descending. We both froze, me on the third step, him on the first.

For a stretched moment, we just looked at each other.

Derek's face was unreadable—carefully blank in a way that seemed deliberate. His eyes met mine, and I saw something flash there. Recognition. Hurt, maybe. Something else I couldn't identify in the split second before his expression closed off completely.

He looked tired, I realized. Like maybe he hadn't been sleeping well either. There were shadows under his eyes that I'd never noticed before, though maybe I'd never been close enough to see them. Or maybe I'd just never looked.

"Excuse me," he said, voice polite and distant.

He moved to the right. I moved to the left, except he'd also shifted left at the same moment, and we did that awkward dance where you mirror someone trying to get past you. Under any other circumstances it might have been funny.

Now it just made my chest ache.

"Sorry," I muttered, and stepped firmly to the right.

Derek went left and continued up the steps without looking back.

I made it halfway to Ashford Hall before I had to stop, lean against the rough brick wall of the science building, and catch my breath.

This was impossible.

"You're miserable," Madison announced that night.

We were in our dorm room, supposedly studying. I was lying on my bed surrounded by textbooks I wasn't reading, and Madison was at her desk pretending to work on her field hockey stats but mostly watching me with increasing concern.

"I'm fine," I said automatically.

"Emma. You've been staring at the same page of your history textbook for twenty minutes, and it's upside down."

I looked down. She was right.

With a sigh, I closed the book and sat up. "Okay. I'm not fine."

Madison swiveled her desk chair to face me fully. "Does this have anything to do with why you've been avoiding all the routes where you might run into Derek Lane? Or why he didn't show up to English class on Wednesday?"

I should have known Madison would notice. She noticed everything, even when she pretended not to.

"Something happened," I said carefully.

"I gathered that much." Madison's tone was gentle. "You want to talk about it?"

And suddenly, I did. The whole story came spilling out—the letter exchange feature, Compass and Navigator, three months of correspondence, the revelation in the magazine office. Madison listened without interrupting, her eyes growing progressively wider.

"Wait," she said when I finally finished. "Derek Lane is Compass? Derek *Lane*?"

"I know."

"The guy you argue with in every English class?"

"Yes."

"The guy you've been complaining about since September?"

"Madison—"

"The guy you also can't stop talking about?"

I stared at her. "I don't—I haven't been—"

"Emma." Madison's expression was somewhere between sympathetic and exasperated. "You mention Derek at least three times a week. 'Derek challenged my reading today.' 'Derek had an interesting point about symbolism.' 'Derek is so infuriating.' You talk about him constantly."

"Because he argues with me constantly!"

"Or," Madison said slowly, "because you've been falling for him all year and didn't realize it."

The words hit like a physical blow. "That's not—no. Absolutely not. I was falling for *Compass*."

"Who is Derek."

"Who is not the same as Derek!" I heard my voice rising and forced it back down. "Compass is vulnerable and understanding. Derek is all sarcasm and intellectual challenges. They're completely different people."

Madison regarded me thoughtfully. "Are they though? Or are they just different sides of the same person?"

"They don't fit together," I insisted. "The person who writes those letters, who understands my creative ambitions and fears about choosing writing over security—that's not the same person who tears apart my essay interpretations for sport."

"Maybe Derek shows vulnerability in writing because it feels safer," Madison offered. "And maybe his debate style is actually his way of showing interest in you."

I shook my head immediately. "No. You don't know how he argues. It's not interest, it's—"

"What? Engagement? Attention? Challenge?" Madison leaned forward. "Emma, you're the smartest person in that English class, probably in our whole year. And Derek is right there with you. Maybe challenging your ideas is his way of taking you seriously."

That's what Derek had said too. In the magazine office, before I'd asked him to leave. *Challenging someone isn't dismissing them.*

But I wasn't ready to accept that interpretation.

"You didn't see his face when he realized I was Navigator," I said quietly. "He looked as shocked as I felt. Like the person he'd been writing to couldn't possibly be the person he knows in real life."

"Or maybe he was just surprised, not disappointed."

"You're taking his side."

"I'm not taking sides." Madison's voice was firm but kind. "I'm trying to help you see that maybe these two versions of Derek aren't as irreconcilable as you think."

I wanted to argue, to explain how wrong she was. But I was exhausted from three days of avoidance and confusion and missing something I couldn't quite name.

"I need to see if what I felt was real," I said instead. "If the connection with Compass was real, or if it was just some fantasy I built up because I didn't know who he actually was."

Madison nodded. "How are you going to do that?"

"I don't know yet."

That night, after Madison had fallen asleep, I pulled out the folder where I'd saved all of Compass's letters. I'd kept every single one, organized chronologically, each read and reread so many times I could probably recite them from memory.

Now I spread them across my bed and tried to see Derek in the words.

*I'm supposed to have everything figured out—the perfect grades, the prestigious college, the practical career. But what I really want is to write. Not essays for English class, but real writing. Philosophy and poetry and ideas that might not have any practical application at all.*

Could Derek have written that? Derek, who seemed so confident in his role as top student?

*Sometimes I think people see what they expect to see. They look at my arguments and assume I'm combative, but really I just want to understand how other people think. I want to engage with ideas fully, turn them over and examine them from every angle.*

My breath caught. That sounded exactly like what Derek had said in the magazine office. About why he challenged my interpretations.

*I'm afraid that if I show people my real self—the uncertain, creative, questioning parts—they'll be disappointed. Easier to hide behind what they already expect.*

I read that line three times. Looked at the date on the letter—from last month, right after one of our most heated debates in English class. Right after Derek had argued for fifteen minutes about the unreliable narrator concept while I'd defended an emotional reading of the same text.

He'd written this letter the same day.

The same day he'd seemed completely confident in class, absolutely certain in his analysis, he'd written to me about being afraid to show his real self. About hiding behind what people expected.

I picked up another letter, dated from even earlier in our correspondence.

*Today someone told me my argument style was exhausting. They meant it as criticism, but I didn't know how to explain that arguing is how I connect with ideas—and with people who interest me. I don't know how to engage halfway.*

My throat tightened. Had he been writing about me? About our debates in English class that everyone else found entertaining but that sometimes left me frustrated and drained?

Had he been trying to connect with me all along, and I'd completely missed it?

My hands were shaking again.

Maybe Madison was right. Maybe Derek had been showing me different sides of the same person all along, and I'd just been too focused on the surface to see deeper.

Or maybe I was so desperate for the connection to be real that I was convincing myself it could work.

I looked out the window toward Bancroft Hall across the quad. A few windows still glowed with desk lamps—students studying late or just not ready for sleep.

One of those windows was Room 42.

Was Derek in there right now, writing? Reading? Lying awake thinking about Navigator's letters the way I was thinking about Compass's?

Or had he already decided that Emma Sullivan wasn't who he thought Navigator would be, and moved on?

I gathered up the letters carefully, returned them to their folder. But I couldn't bring myself to put the folder away. Instead, I kept it on my nightstand where I could see it.

Evidence. Of what, I wasn't sure yet.

But definitely evidence of something.
