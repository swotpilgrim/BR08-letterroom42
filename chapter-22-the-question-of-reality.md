# Chapter 22: The Question of Reality

That night, I couldn't sleep.

Madison had already gone to bed hours ago, her steady breathing the only sound in our dorm room besides the occasional creak of old building settling. I lay in the dark, staring at the ceiling, replaying my conversation with Andrew over and over.

*Derek Lane has been falling for you since September.*

Could that possibly be true? And if it was, what did I do with that information now, after everything that had happened?

"Emma," Madison's voice cut through the darkness, making me jump. "You're not sleeping."

"Sorry. Did I wake you?"

"No." I heard her shift in bed, sitting up. "I've been awake too. Listening to you toss and turn for the past hour." She reached over and turned on her desk lamp, bathing the room in soft light. "We need to talk."

I sat up too, pulling my knees to my chest. "About what?"

Madison gave me a look. "About Derek. About Compass. About the fact that you've been miserable for over a week and clearly have no idea what to do about it."

"I talked to Andrew today," I admitted. "Derek's roommate."

"And?"

"And he said Derek is just as miserable as I am. That Derek's been falling for me since September—both as Navigator and as Emma." The words felt strange saying aloud. "I don't know if I believe that."

"Why not?"

"Because—" I struggled to articulate it. "Because if Derek was falling for me, why hide behind Compass? Why not just tell me in person?"

"Emma." Madison's voice was patient but firm. "Can I ask you something?"

"Okay."

"Was the connection with Compass real?"

The question caught me off guard. "What do you mean?"

"I mean exactly what I said. The correspondence, the letters, the understanding you felt—was it real? Or was it just some fantasy you built up because you didn't know who was writing?"

I thought about Compass's letters. The way they'd made me feel seen, understood, less alone in my ambitions and fears. The conversations about creative passion versus practical expectations, about hiding parts of yourself that don't fit others' visions of who you should be.

"It was real," I said quietly. "The understanding, the shared dreams, the vulnerability—all of it felt genuine and meaningful."

"Okay." Madison nodded. "So if the connection was real, and the understanding was real, and the feelings were real—why do they stop being real just because you know who wrote the letters?"

"Because—" I started, then stopped. "Because knowing changes everything."

"Does it though?" Madison leaned forward. "The words didn't change. Derek wrote those letters. Those were his real thoughts and feelings and fears. They didn't disappear the moment you learned his name."

"But the person I fell for in the letters—that's not who Derek is in real life."

"Isn't it?" Madison challenged. "Or is it just a side of Derek you hadn't seen before? A way of expressing himself that he doesn't use in person?"

I pulled my blanket tighter around myself. "The anonymity allowed us both to be open in ways we can't be face-to-face. Compass could be vulnerable because he was anonymous. I could be honest because Navigator wasn't connected to me. That safety is gone now."

"Why?" Madison's question was simple but piercing. "What's actually preventing you from being that honest and vulnerable with Derek in person besides your own fear?"

The words landed hard. Because Madison was right. Nothing was preventing vulnerability except me. Except fear.

"It's different face-to-face," I said, but it sounded weak even to me.

"Different how?"

"More... real. More dangerous."

"Dangerous how?"

I drew in a breath, trying to find the words for what I'd been avoiding thinking about too directly. "If I let myself see Derek as Compass—as the whole person, both the vulnerable writer and the argumentative debater—then I might..."

"Fall for him completely?" Madison supplied gently.

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

"And that scares you."

"Yes." The admission came out small. "Because falling for words on a page is safe. If Compass had rejected me, it would have hurt, but it would have been this anonymous hurt. I could have moved on, told myself it wasn't real anyway because we didn't really know each other."

"But falling for Derek—the real, whole, complicated Derek—is different," Madison said.

"Because he's right here. Because I'd have to see him every day in class, on campus. Because the rejection would be so much more..." I searched for the word.

"Real," Madison finished.

I nodded again. That was exactly it. Anonymous rejection was safer because it felt less real, less permanent. But real rejection from Derek-in-person would be devastating in a way I wasn't sure I could handle.

"So you're protecting yourself," Madison said. It wasn't a question, just an observation.

"I guess I am."

"By telling yourself that Compass and Derek are two different people. By insisting the connection can't be real if it's Derek."

"When you say it like that, it sounds—"

"Like you're lying to yourself?" Madison's voice was kind, not judgmental. "Yeah. Kind of."

I pulled my knees tighter to my chest. "I don't know how to stop being afraid."

"I'm not sure you can," Madison said. "Stop being afraid, I mean. Fear is part of falling for someone. Vulnerability is scary because it means you might get hurt."

"So what do I do?"

"You decide whether playing safe is worth never having anything real." Madison leaned back against her headboard. "You can keep telling yourself Derek and Compass are irreconcilable. You can maintain your distance, protect your heart, avoid the possibility of real rejection. But you'll also lose the possibility of real connection."

"I had real connection with Compass."

"Did you?" Madison's challenge was gentle. "Or did you have safe connection? Connection that felt real because you controlled how much of yourself you showed, because you could walk away any time, because the other person was just words on a page without a face or a presence or complications?"

The question struck deep. Because maybe Madison was right. Maybe what I'd loved about the correspondence wasn't just the vulnerability and understanding, but the safety of it. The control. The lack of real risk.

"Derek took a real risk," Madison continued. "Being vulnerable in those letters. And then when you found out he was Compass, he took another risk by admitting it was real, that it mattered to him. He's been honest with you from the beginning about who he is—both versions. The vulnerable writer and the argumentative debater."

"I know," I whispered.

"And you told him you couldn't see how they fit together. That you couldn't reconcile the two."

"I was confused. Scared."

"I know you were." Madison's voice was warm with sympathy. "But Emma, can you see now that Derek and Compass aren't two different people? They're just different facets of the same complicated person. And refusing to see them as integrated is really just you refusing to risk falling for the whole person."

I sat with that truth for a long moment. Outside our window, campus was dark and quiet, most students asleep. Tomorrow there would be classes and activities and the normal rhythm of Windermere life. But in this room, in this late-night conversation, everything felt stripped down to essential truth.

"What if I let myself see Derek as a whole person and he doesn't want me anymore?" I asked. "What if I've already ruined it by pushing him away?"

"What if you haven't?" Madison countered. "What if Derek is sitting in Room 42 right now having the same fears? What if he's convinced you only wanted Compass and could never want Derek?"

I thought about Derek in the library, staring at old magazine issues. The defeated look on his face. What Andrew had said about Derek feeling like everything was ruined.

"Andrew said I should talk to Derek," I admitted. "Be honest about being confused and scared but also about missing the connection."

"Andrew's smart."

"I don't know what to say though. How do I bridge the gap between Emma Sullivan who argued with him in English class and Navigator who fell for his letters? How do I show him I'm trying to see him wholly when I've spent a week telling him I can't?"

"Start with the truth," Madison said, echoing Andrew's advice. "Tell Derek you were wrong. That you were scared and reacted badly. That you're trying to understand how both sides of him fit together because you want to see the whole person."

"What if it's not enough?"

"What if it is?"

I looked at Madison, her expression kind and hopeful in the lamplight. She believed in me more than I believed in myself right now.

"I'm terrified," I admitted.

"I know." Madison smiled. "That's how you know it's real."

After Madison turned off the lamp and settled back into bed, I lay in the darkness thinking about her words. About the difference between safe connection and real connection. About the risk Derek had taken being vulnerable in letters and then admitting it was real.

About whether I was brave enough to take the same risk.

The question wasn't whether Compass and Derek could be integrated. The question was whether I was willing to see them as the same complicated, multifaceted person they'd always been.

Whether I was willing to fall for Derek—really fall, with all the risk and vulnerability that entailed—instead of hiding behind the fantasy of Compass as someone separate and safe.

Outside, a light was still on in one of Bancroft Hall's windows.

Room 42.

Was Derek awake too? Lying in bed thinking about Navigator and Emma and connections that felt impossible to bridge?

Or had he already decided I wasn't worth the complication, that someone who couldn't see him clearly wasn't someone he wanted to be vulnerable with?

I didn't know.

But maybe it was time to find out.
