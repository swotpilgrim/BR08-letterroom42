# Chapter 12: Unexpected Enjoyment

Mr. Harrison announces a major analytical paper due before winter break: choose any novel we've studied, apply a critical lens, twenty pages.

"Wednesday, we'll workshop your thesis statements in pairs," he says. "Practice for making your ideas intelligible to someone who might disagree with you."

---

Wednesday arrives cold and bright. I've chosen *The Great Gatsby* for a feminist reading—examining how Daisy, Jordan, and Myrtle navigate a patriarchal world that offers them limited agency, and how Fitzgerald both critiques and reinforces those limitations.

Mr. Harrison assigns workshop pairs randomly. Of course I end up with Derek.

"Sullivan." Derek slides into the chair next to mine, bringing with him the scent of cold air and coffee. "What are you analyzing?"

"*Gatsby*. Feminist lens." I pull out my notes. "You?"

"Same book. American Dream critique through Marxist lens."

"Of course you're doing Marxist analysis."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"You love analyzing power structures and economic systems." I don't mean it critically—it's just true. Derek gravitates toward arguments about class and capital.

He grins. "And you love analyzing gender dynamics and limited agency."

"Fair." I spread my notes on the table. "So we're approaching the same text from different angles."

"Perfect workshop pairing then. We can find the overlaps."

The Derek I'm sitting next to today feels different from the Derek who argued about Wordsworth's philosophical structure. His teasing has a lighter quality. Less combative, more collaborative.

"Hit me with your thesis," he says.

I read from my notes: "Fitzgerald's female characters are trapped in a patriarchal system that offers them beauty and marriage as their only currencies, but their varying responses to this limitation reveal both the system's crushing power and the different survival strategies women employ within it."

Derek nods thoughtfully. "That's strong. Daisy's passivity versus Jordan's cynicism versus Myrtle's doomed ambition."

"Exactly." I'm surprised he grasped it so quickly. "What's yours?"

"The American Dream functions as capitalist mythology that promises class mobility while actually reinforcing existing hierarchies. Gatsby's wealth can buy the appearance of belonging but never actual acceptance because the Dream itself is structured to preserve elite power."

"That's—" I pause. "That's really good. And it intersects with my argument because part of how the elite preserve power is through controlling women's sexuality and marriage prospects."

"Yes!" Derek leans forward, energized. "Daisy can't choose Gatsby even if she wants to because the patriarchal system that governs marriage is also the class system that protects old money from new."

"And Jordan survives by refusing to play the marriage game, but that refusal also limits her power because she's outside the primary system of female advancement."

We're talking fast now, building on each other's ideas. Derek suggests a passage about Tom's control over both Daisy and Myrtle that supports my feminist reading. I point out a scene about Gatsby's parties that reinforces his Marxist interpretation.

"You know what's interesting," Derek says, flipping through his tagged copy of the book, "is that Fitzgerald seems both seduced by wealth and disgusted by it. Like he wants to critique the system but also kind of loves the beauty it creates."

"Same with gender. He sees how patriarchy crushes women but he also romanticizes Daisy's helplessness." I find the passage I'm thinking of. "Look—'Her voice is full of money.' That line is simultaneously critique and fetishization."

"Fitzgerald's complicit in the systems he's exposing."

"Exactly. Which makes the novel more complicated than simple critique."

Derek grins at me. "I love when you get excited about literary analysis. Your whole face lights up."

I feel my cheeks warm. "You're one to talk. You've been gesturing wildly for the past five minutes."

"Have I?" He looks at his hands like they've betrayed him. "I tend to do that when I'm thinking hard."

"I've noticed."

There's a moment where we're just looking at each other, something unspoken hanging in the air. Then Derek clears his throat.

"So, um. This is really helpful. Your feminist angle is making me see things in my argument I hadn't articulated yet." He pauses. "Want to grab coffee from the student center? Keep working through this?"

I should say no. I have magazine work, homework, a response to Compass to draft.

But I find myself saying, "Yeah, okay. Coffee sounds good."

---

The student center is busy with the lunch crowd, but we find a small table by the window overlooking the quad. Derek gets coffee for both of us—he remembers I take mine with cream and sugar, which surprises me—and we spread our books and notes across the table.

"Okay, so the green light," Derek says, jumping right back in. "What's your feminist reading of Gatsby's obsession with it?"

"Daisy as unattainable object rather than actual person. The green light represents his idealized version of her, which has nothing to do with who she actually is."

"And my Marxist reading would say the green light represents the promise of class mobility—always visible, never reachable, keeping people striving for something they'll never actually achieve."

"Both work. Fitzgerald using the same symbol for gendered and classed forms of unattainability."

Derek scribbles a note. "That's going in my paper. With citation to our discussion."

"You don't have to cite casual conversation."

"Yes I do. It's your idea. You get credit." He looks up. "That's how intellectual honesty works, Sullivan."

There's something touching about his earnestness. About the fact that Derek, who loves to argue and challenge, is also genuinely committed to giving credit where it's due.

We talk for an hour, the conversation flowing easily from textual analysis to Fitzgerald's biography to the broader questions of how literature both reflects and shapes cultural values. Derek is funny when he's not being deliberately contrary—he makes a joke about Nick Carraway being the most judgmental non-judgmental narrator in literature that makes me laugh so hard I almost spill my coffee.

"I've never seen you laugh like that," Derek observes.

"Like what?"

"Unselfconsciously. Usually you're so controlled, even when something's funny."

"That's not true."

"It absolutely is. You have your editor face—professional, composed. Your classroom face—engaged but careful. And very occasionally, like just now, your actual face."

I don't know what to say to that. The fact that Derek has been paying enough attention to distinguish my different modes of presentation feels significant somehow.

"What's your actual face like?" I ask instead.

"Probably this." He gestures at himself. "I'm bad at pretending. What you see is generally what you get."

"Argumentative and contrary?"

"Engaged and curious," he corrects. "But sure, we can go with your interpretation."

"See? You're doing it right now. Arguing about how to describe yourself."

"Because you're wrong about why I argue." Derek's expression turns more serious. "I don't do it to be contrary. I do it because that's how I think. By pushing against ideas, testing them, finding the places where they break down or where they hold up under pressure."

"That's..." I pause, considering. "Actually that makes sense. You're using argument as methodology, not just performance."

"Thank you." He sounds genuinely pleased that I understand.

We return to discussing our papers, but something has shifted. I'm seeing Derek differently—not as an adversary to survive but as someone whose company I'm actively enjoying. His intelligence, which seemed antagonistic in class, feels collaborative here. His challenges make me think more clearly instead of just making me defensive.

When we finally pack up to leave, I realize two hours have passed.

"This was really helpful," Derek says as we walk back toward the academic building. "I mean it. You've made my paper better."

"Likewise. Your Marxist lens helps me see what I was missing about class dynamics."

"Maybe we should study together more often."

He says it casually, but I feel something flutter in my chest.

"Maybe," I agree, trying to match his casual tone.

We part ways at the quad—Derek heading to Bancroft Hall, me toward the library. But I catch myself watching him walk away, noticing things I haven't noticed before. The way he carries his bag slung over one shoulder. The way he walks with his hands in his pockets. The way he turns to wave before disappearing around the corner of the building.

And the fact that I'm sorry to see him go.

"You're smiling at your homework," Madison observes that evening.

I look up from my laptop where I'm outlining my *Gatsby* paper. "Am I?"

"You are. Either that paper is really exciting or something else is making you happy."

"I had a good workshop session today. Derek and I—" I catch myself. "We worked on our papers together."

Madison sets down her field hockey playbook. "Derek. The one you find frustrating and irritating."

"He's... less frustrating when we're collaborating instead of competing."

"Interesting development." Madison's trying not to smile. "Tell me more."

"There's nothing to tell. We talked about *The Great Gatsby*. He had good insights. We got coffee. It was productive."

"You got coffee with Derek Lane."

"To discuss our papers."

"For two hours, based on how long you were gone."

I close my laptop. "It was a good conversation, okay? He's actually really smart when he's not being deliberately contrary. And funny. And..." I trail off, realizing what I'm saying.

"And you enjoyed spending time with him," Madison finishes.

"I did." I sound surprised by my own admission. "That's weird, right? Given how much he usually irritates me?"

"Not weird. Maybe you're finally seeing him without your preconceptions in the way."

I think about how my view of Derek as purely argumentative has made it hard to see his other qualities—genuine passion, intellectual generosity, actually listening.

But then I think about Compass. About his vulnerable letters. About falling for him while also enjoying time with Derek.

"It doesn't mean anything," I say, more to myself than to Madison. "Derek and I had a productive academic conversation. That's different from actually connecting with someone."

"Is it though?"

"Yes. Compass and I connect on a deeper level. Emotional truth, not just intellectual engagement."

Madison looks skeptical but doesn't push.

That night, drafting my response to Compass's latest letter, I almost mention the coffee with Derek. Almost write about the confusing experience of enjoying time with someone I thought I understood.

But I don't. Because bringing Derek into the space I have with Compass feels like contaminating something pure. Compass represents one kind of connection—deep, honest, vulnerable. Derek represents something else—challenging, stimulating, increasingly complicated.

They're separate. Different. Unrelated.

At least, that's what I tell myself as I seal my letter to Compass and try not to think about Derek's smile over coffee, or the way he waved before walking away, or the strange disappointment I felt when our conversation had to end.

It doesn't mean anything.

Probably.
