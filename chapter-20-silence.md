# Chapter 20: Silence

After our confrontation in the hallway, Derek and I stopped speaking entirely.

Not the loaded silences of avoidance, not the awkward pauses when we accidentally crossed paths. This was complete, deliberate silence. In English class, we sat in our respective seats and existed in parallel universes. On campus, we took different routes. In the dining hall, we unconsciously maintained distance.

It should have been a relief.

It wasn't.

The next issue of *The Windermere Review* came out on Thursday. I'd stayed up late on Wednesday night finishing the layout, organizing the poetry and prose pieces, proofreading everything three times. The magazine looked good—maybe our best issue yet.

But one feature was conspicuously absent.

No new letters from Compass. No new response from Navigator.

I'd stared at that blank space in the layout where the letter exchange typically appeared, the submissions from other anonymous correspondents seeming sparse without our conversation anchoring the feature. In the end, I'd filled the space with an extra poem and pretended I didn't notice the absence.

By Friday afternoon, other people noticed.

"Emma?" Sarah knocked on the magazine office door, even though it stood open. She'd developed this habit of checking before entering, like the office had become some kind of sanctuary she didn't want to violate. "Can I ask you something?"

I looked up from the submission I was pretending to read—same paragraph, fifth time through, and I still couldn't tell you what it said. "Sure."

"A bunch of people have been asking about Compass and Navigator." Sarah shifted her weight, uncomfortable. "Their correspondence was really popular. People were invested in it. And now there's just... nothing."

"Some correspondences run their course," I said, echoing what I'd told her last week. The words felt hollow.

"But they seemed so—" Sarah paused, searching for the right word. "Connected. Like they really understood each other. It seems weird that they'd just stop."

"Maybe they realized they didn't understand each other as well as they thought." The bitterness in my voice surprised both of us.

Sarah's eyes widened slightly. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." I wasn't fine. I was the opposite of fine. But I didn't know how to explain that to Sarah without explaining everything, and I couldn't explain everything without the whole situation becoming even more real than it already was.

After Sarah left, I pulled out my journal. I'd been writing in it constantly this week—pages and pages of thoughts I couldn't organize, feelings I couldn't name. Grief, mostly. Over losing Compass, even though Derek was still right here at Windermere.

Except I hadn't lost Compass. Compass had never existed as a separate person. He'd always been Derek.

But that truth didn't make the grief feel any less real.

I'd tried writing to him three times this week. Actual letters, the kind I would have submitted to the magazine exchange. Each time, I'd gotten a few sentences in before the impossibility of it stopped me.

*Dear Compass, How do I write to someone I thought I knew but never really knew at all?*

*Dear Compass, I miss writing to you. I miss the understanding and vulnerability. But I don't know if any of it was real.*

*Dear Compass, I'm sorry. For not seeing you. For asking you to leave. For being too afraid to—*

I'd torn up all three attempts.

How could I write to Compass when Compass was Derek, and Derek and I couldn't even look at each other without hurt and anger getting in the way?

I saw Derek from across the library on Saturday afternoon.

He sat in one of the wooden carrels near the window, surrounded by textbooks but not appearing to read any of them. Instead, he had an old issue of *The Windermere Review* open in front of him—one from earlier this semester, I realized. One of the issues with our letter exchange.

He was just staring at it.

Even from a distance, I could see the tension in his shoulders, the defeated slump that was so unlike his usual posture. Andrew sat in the carrel next to him, clearly studying, but he kept glancing over with concern.

I should have left. Should have gathered my books and found somewhere else to work where I wouldn't have to see Derek looking like I'd broken something essential in him.

Instead, I stayed, hidden behind a bookshelf, watching.

Andrew finally said something—I couldn't hear what from this distance. Derek shook his head without looking up from the magazine. Andrew said something else, more insistent this time.

Derek's response was sharper. I saw Andrew's expression shift to something between frustration and sympathy.

Then Derek closed the magazine, pushed it away from him, and put his head in his hands.

The gesture was so defeated, so unlike the confident Derek I knew from English class debates, that I had to press my hand over my mouth to keep from making a sound.

Andrew reached over, gripped Derek's shoulder. Kept talking, his voice low and earnest. Derek lifted his head, said something that made Andrew lean in closer.

Their conversation continued for several minutes. I knew I should stop watching, should give them privacy. But I was frozen, desperate to understand what Derek was saying even though I couldn't hear the words.

Finally, Andrew stood up, said something that looked like it might have been forceful or encouraging, and walked toward the library exit. Derek sat alone at the carrel, the old magazine issue still pushed to the side, his expression hollowed out.

I waited until Andrew had left completely, until the library had settled back into quiet study-hall atmosphere. Then I made myself leave too, slipping out a side exit before Derek could see me.

But the image of him sitting there, surrounded by books and old letters, looking completely lost—that stayed with me.

That night, Madison found me sitting on my bed with my journal open, staring at another failed attempt to write to Compass.

"You're miserable," she said. Not a question. An observation.

"I miss him." The admission came out quietly. "I miss Compass. I miss writing to him and reading his letters and feeling like someone understood me."

Madison sat down next to me, read over my shoulder at the unfinished letter. "So write to him."

"I can't."

"Why not?"

"Because Compass is Derek, and Derek and I—" I gestured helplessly. "We're not talking. We had this awful fight in the hallway, and he basically told me I can't see him as a whole person, and he's right, Madison. He's completely right."

"Then maybe start there," Madison suggested gently.

"Where?"

"With being honest. Tell Derek—tell Compass—tell whoever—that you're struggling with this. That you don't know how to reconcile the person you fell for with the person you thought you knew."

"I already did that. In the magazine office when we first found out. That's what started this whole mess."

"No," Madison corrected. "You told Derek you couldn't reconcile him with Compass. That's different from saying you're trying to but don't know how. One is rejection. The other is honesty about the process."

I looked at my journal, at the unfinished letters. Maybe Madison was right. Maybe the problem wasn't that I couldn't write to Derek-as-Compass. Maybe the problem was that I was trying to write to Compass separately from Derek, maintaining the same compartmentalization that had gotten us into this situation.

"I don't think he wants to hear from me," I said. "After what I said in the hallway—"

"Emma." Madison waited until I looked at her. "Have you considered that Derek might be just as miserable as you are? That he might miss Navigator the same way you miss Compass?"

I thought about Derek in the library, staring at old magazine issues. The defeated slump of his shoulders. The way he'd put his head in his hands like the weight of everything was too much.

"I saw him today," I admitted. "In the library. He was reading old issues of the magazine. The ones with our letters."

"And?"

"And he looked..." I struggled to find the word. "Lost. Like I'd taken something essential from him."

"You took yourself from him," Madison said quietly. "Navigator. The person who understood him and saw him and made him feel safe being vulnerable. You were that person, Emma. And then you told him it couldn't be real because he wasn't who you expected."

The words hit hard because they were true. I'd been so focused on my own hurt and confusion that I hadn't really considered what this revelation had done to Derek. He'd lost Navigator the same way I'd lost Compass—except he'd also lost the possibility of that connection translating to real life.

Because I'd told him I couldn't reconcile the two versions of him.

"What do I do?" I asked.

Madison looked at the unfinished letter in my journal. "Maybe stop trying to write to Compass as if he's separate from Derek. Write to the whole person. Be honest about being confused and hurt and struggling. But also be honest about missing the connection and wanting to understand."

"What if he doesn't want that anymore?"

"What if he does?"

I sat with that question long after Madison had returned to her desk to finish her homework. The dormitory settled into its evening rhythm—showers running, music playing quietly, muted conversations in the hallways.

Across the quad, lights were on in Bancroft Hall. One of those windows was Room 42.

Was Derek in there right now, sitting with his own confusion and hurt? Was he also wondering if the connection had been real, if it could have translated beyond anonymous letters?

Or had he decided Emma Sullivan wasn't worth the complication, that Navigator had been a fantasy that couldn't survive contact with reality?

I looked down at my journal. Picked up my pen.

*Dear Derek,*

I stopped. Stared at those two words. Not Compass. Derek.

The whole person. The vulnerable writer and the argumentative debater and everything in between.

But I couldn't write the next sentence. Couldn't figure out what came after acknowledging his full name, his full self.

So I closed the journal and turned off my desk lamp and lay in bed staring at the ceiling.

Missing someone who was right here at Windermere.

Missing a connection I'd helped destroy by being too afraid to see it clearly.

Missing letters that could only be real if I stopped trying to keep their author separate from the complicated, challenging boy I'd been falling for all along.
